Replace the current blog/resources section with a Resources Hub band that lists the main resource destinations as simple tiles. No article cards, no pagination, no tooltips. Keep it fast, accessible, and inside the global container.

Placement & scope
	•	Lives after Pricing and before FAQ.
	•	Update only this section and its data/config. Do not change routes, header, or other sections.

Objectives (what this section must communicate)
	•	One-stop access to: Blog, Help Desk, Free Guides, Contact Support.
	•	Each destination has a short description and a single, obvious link.
	•	Scan fast on mobile; zero clutter.

⸻

Structure (mobile → desktop)
	1.	Header (left-aligned, inside global container)
	•	Eyebrow: Resources
	•	H2: All resources, one place
	•	Support (one sentence): From how-to guides to product help and direct support—everything is here.
	2.	Resource tiles grid (no articles, just destinations)
	•	Mobile: 1 column (stacked).
	•	Desktop (lg+): 2×2 grid (4 equal tiles).
	•	Each tile anatomy (top → bottom):
	•	Small icon (monochrome) + Title
	•	One-line description
	•	Inline link row with arrow (e.g., Visit blog →)
	•	The entire tile is clickable (link wraps the card; also keep inline link text for clarity).
	•	Tiles to include (exact labels & copy):
	•	Blog — Stories, tips, and product insights. → /resources or /blog
	•	Help Desk — Step-by-step answers to common questions. → /help or /docs
	•	Free Guides — Downloadable checklists and playbooks. → /guides or /resources/guides
	•	Contact Support — Get help from a human—fast. → /contact or /support
	•	If a destination doesn’t exist yet, point to a placeholder route you own; do not use external domains.
	3.	Footer row (optional, single line)
	•	Left: View all resources → → /resources
	•	Right: none (keep it clean)

⸻

Visual & motion
	•	Use existing tokens: navy canvas, rounded-xl tiles, subtle inner border (bg-white/5, border-white/10).
	•	Icons are simple (no color noise); keep consistent sizing.
	•	Motion limited to hover/focus lift or inner shadow; respect prefers-reduced-motion.
	•	No carousels, no auto-rotate, no images required.

⸻

Accessibility
	•	One h2 for the band; each tile title is an h3.
	•	Whole tile is a single anchor; include visible focus ring and 44px+ hit area.
	•	Icons aria-hidden="true"; text must convey meaning without color.
	•	Link text is descriptive (e.g., Visit blog →), not “Learn more”.

⸻

Performance
	•	No third-party embeds, no tooltips/portals.
	•	Zero CLS: fixed paddings and consistent tile heights.
	•	No images required; if you add one, use WebP with intrinsic width/height and lazy loading.

Data model (tiny constants file)

// resourcesHubData.ts
export const RESOURCES_DESTINATIONS = [
  { key: "blog",   title: "Blog",           blurb: "Stories, tips, and product insights.",          href: "/resources" },
  { key: "help",   title: "Help Desk",      blurb: "Step-by-step answers to common questions.",     href: "/help" },
  { key: "guides", title: "Free Guides",    blurb: "Downloadable checklists and playbooks.",        href: "/guides" },
  { key: "support",title: "Contact Support",blurb: "Get help from a human—fast.",                   href: "/contact" }
];

⸻

Copy to render (exact strings)
	•	Eyebrow: Resources
	•	H2: All resources, one place
	•	Support: From how-to guides to product help and direct support—everything is here.
	•	Tile links:
	•	Blog → Visit blog →
	•	Help Desk → Go to help desk →
	•	Free Guides → Browse guides →
	•	Contact Support → Contact support →
	•	Footer (optional): View all resources →

⸻

Interaction rules
	•	Entire tile is clickable and contains an inline text link; both target the same route.
	•	Keyboard users can tab to each tile and press Enter to navigate.
	•	No filters, no sorting, no lazy fetching—static, fast, and reliable.

⸻

Analytics
	•	resources_hub.view (once when ≥35% of band is in view)
	•	resources_hub.tile_click with { key }
	•	If footer shown: resources_hub.view_all_click

⸻

	1.	Old articles/cards area is replaced by a simple 4-tile Resources Hub inside the global container; headings are left-aligned.
