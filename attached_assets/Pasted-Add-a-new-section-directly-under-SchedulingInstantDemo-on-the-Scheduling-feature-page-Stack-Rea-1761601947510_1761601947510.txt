Add a new section directly under SchedulingInstantDemo on the Scheduling feature page.

Stack: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui (Radix), Wouter. Mobile-first. WCAG AA+. “Pro-Blueprint” theme.

Create `src/sections/SchedulingPainSolve.tsx` and render it immediately after the previous section in `src/routes/features/scheduling.tsx`.

Requirements:
- Header
  * H2: “Kill scheduling chaos”
  * Sub: “Common field problems paired with the exact fix. Drag, drop, done.”

- Pain → Solve grid
  * Left column: 6 pains as list items.
  * Right column: corresponding solves as list items with bolded action then outcome.
  * Mobile: one column stacked; ≥640px two columns with left pains and right solves aligned by index.
  * Use sharp corners, ring-1 slate-200, subtle shadow class per theme.

- ROI + CTA row
  * Three small cards: “Save 2 hrs/tech/week”, “Fewer no-shows”, “Faster cash cycle”.
  * Buttons: primary Start Free (green #0FB36F), secondary View Pricing (underline with accent #0B5FFF).
  * Provide `data-testid` on primary CTA `mid-cta-start`.

- Accessibility
  * `aria-label` on pains and solutions lists.
  * Ensure focus rings use accent blue #0B5FFF.
  * Links must be reachable by keyboard and have visible focus.

- Styling
  * Add optional light blueprint grid background utility `bg-blueprint` already created; allow a prop to toggle it.
  * No rounded pills. No busy gradients.

- Content (use verbatim):
  Pains:
    1) Last-minute cancel at 2:00
    2) Tech stuck in traffic
    3) Double-booked crew
    4) “Can you come earlier?”
    5) Overlapping routes
    6) Rain delay
  Solves:
    1) Drag to tomorrow 9:00. Customer auto-texted. Slot backfills from waitlist.
    2) Reassign with one drag. Route recalcs. ETA shared.
    3) Drop to first open slot. Clash cleared. No double-booking.
    4) Pull job forward. Parts check runs. New window sent.
    5) Merge nearby jobs. Drive time drops.
    6) Bulk move exterior jobs. Batch notifications go out.

- QA gates
  * No overflow at 375px.
  * Lighthouse on this route: ≥90 Performance, ≥95 Accessibility.
  * Tab order: header → pains → solves → ROI cards → Start Free → View Pricing.
