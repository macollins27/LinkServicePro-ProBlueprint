Perfect. We’re doing the next high-intent feature page: **Work Orders & Mobile Field App**.

This is the page for the tech in the field, the foreman, and the owner who’s tired of paper / “text me the address.” It must scream: “Your crew will actually use this.”

Same format as last time:

* Part A: Page spec (copy, sections, layout)
* Part B: Replit instructions (what to actually build)

You’ll paste Part B into Replit. Don’t rewrite it for them. Let’s go.

---

## A. PAGE SPEC: Work Orders & Mobile Field App

ROUTE / SLUG
`/features/work-orders-mobile`

META

* `<title>`: “Mobile Work Orders App | Photos, Checklists, Signatures, Recurring Visits”
* `<meta name="description">`: “Your crew opens the job, sees where to go, what to do, what to document, and gets the signature. No clipboards. No ‘text me the address.’ Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”

PRIMARY SEO INTENT

* “mobile work order app”
* “field service work orders”
* “HVAC work order app”
* “technician job app”
* “field service technician app checklist photos signature”

H1 (hero heading on page)
“Everything techs need for the job — on their phone.”

Hero Subhead
“Your crew opens the job, sees where to go, what to do, what to take pictures of, and gets the signature. No clipboards. No ‘text me the address.’”

CORE MESSAGE THIS PAGE MUST HAMMER:

* Techs will actually use this.
* You’ll stop getting constant “what’s next?” calls.
* You’ll capture proof (photos, signatures, notes) for liability and upsell.
* You can run recurring/maintenance work and prove history.

PAGE STRUCTURE (4 sections + final CTA band)

1. HERO: “Everything techs need for the job”
2. FIELD EXECUTION CARD: Work orders, photos, signatures
3. MAINTENANCE & RECURRING VISITS
4. ASSET / WARRANTY HISTORY
5. FINAL CTA BAND

We keep the same alternating dark/light pattern, the same CTA-in-every-section rule, and PlanRibbon usage for spotlight cards.

## B. REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

Paste the rest of this section into Replit:

1. Create a new page component for `/features/work-orders-mobile` in our codebase, following the exact structure, content, and styles from Section A above. Use the same design system and accessibility patterns we already established for `/features/scheduling-dispatch`.

2. Head/meta:

   * `<title>Mobile Work Orders App | Photos, Checklists, Signatures, Recurring Visits</title>`
   * `<meta name="description" content="Your crew opens the job, sees where to go, what to do, what to document, and gets the signature. No clipboards. No ‘text me the address.’ Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees." />`
   * Inject JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication`:

     * name: "LinkServicePro Work Orders & Mobile App"
     * applicationCategory: "Field service management software"
     * offers.description: "Start free. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."
   * Use the same utility you used on the Scheduling & Dispatch page for structured data.

3. Build the 5 sections EXACTLY in this order:

   1. HERO (dark navy #0E2A47, two-column grid, phone-style mock on the right)
   2. FIELD EXECUTION CARD (white bg, spotlight card with PlanRibbon "Free → Essential+", and outcome rows in right column)
   3. MAINTENANCE & RECURRING VISITS (bg-slate-50, left text + right spotlight card with PlanRibbon "Essential+")
   4. ASSET / WARRANTY HISTORY (white bg, left spotlight card with PlanRibbon "Premium", right dark trust block)
   5. FINAL CTA BAND (dark navy #0E2A47, centered text + Start Free / View Pricing buttons + TCPA line)

4. Requirements for spotlight cards in sections 2, 3, and 4:

   * Card wrapper:
     `relative bg-white ring-1 ring-slate-200 rounded-xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition duration-150 ease-out motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:transform-none motion-reduce:hover:shadow-sm p-5`
   * Top-right PlanRibbon positioned with `absolute -top-2 -right-2 z-20`.

     * Section 2 main spotlight: `<PlanRibbon plan="Free → Essential+" />`
     * Section 3 spotlight: `<PlanRibbon plan="Essential+" />`
     * Section 4 spotlight: `<PlanRibbon plan="Premium" />`
   * Eyebrow chip pill above headline:

     * `inline-block text-[11px] font-semibold text-slate-700 bg-slate-100 border border-slate-200 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] mb-3`

       * Section 3 card: “Maintenance Plans”
       * Section 4 card: “Asset & Warranty History”
   * Headline: `text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900`
   * Body: `text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed`
   * Bullets: each bullet is a flex row with:

     * Icon `text-[#0B5FFF] w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0` with `aria-hidden="true"`
     * Title `text-slate-700 text-sm font-medium`
     * Supporting line `text-[13px] text-slate-500 leading-snug`
   * Each spotlight card ends with a CTA block:

     * Primary button `bg-[#0B5FFF] text-white font-semibold rounded-md px-4 py-2 text-sm shadow-sm hover:opacity-90 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none`
     * Below that, blue text link: `text-[#0B5FFF] text-sm font-medium hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 rounded`

5. Icons:

   * Use meaningful lucide icons:

     * Clipboards / checkmarks for work orders and checklists.
     * Camera or Image icon for “photo capture.”
     * Signature icon (Pen tool / Edit3).
     * Repeat / RefreshCw for recurring.
     * ShieldCheck or Shield for liability protection.
     * MapPin / Navigation for address & routing clarity.
   * DO NOT reuse the same icon everywhere. Each bullet must feel intentional.

6. “Outcome rows” in Section 2 (right column):

   * These are NOT cards. Just stacked flex rows with icon + text.
   * Style:

     * Icon column: icon in `text-[#0B5FFF] w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0` `aria-hidden="true"`.
     * Text column:

       * Headline: `text-slate-900 text-base font-semibold`
       * Copy: `text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed`
   * After the 3 outcome rows, include a text link:

     * Text: “See Scheduling & Dispatch →”
     * href: `/features/scheduling-dispatch`
     * Style: `text-[#0B5FFF] text-sm font-medium hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 rounded`

7. Section 3 right-column “Maintenance Plans” spotlight card must include a gray placeholder mock inside:

   * `div className="bg-slate-100 rounded-lg h-32 w-full mt-4 flex items-center justify-center text-[11px] text-slate-500"`
   * inner text: “Plan Schedule / Next Visits / Billing Status”

8. Section 4 right-side trust block:

   * Container:
     `bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl p-5 ring-1 ring-slate-800 shadow-sm flex flex-col justify-between`
   * Headline: `text-white font-semibold text-lg`
   * Body: `text-white/70 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6`
   * Two CTAs:

     * Outline button:

       * `border border-white/30 text-white text-sm font-semibold rounded-md px-4 py-2 hover:bg-white/10 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none`
       * Text: “See Profit Tracking”
       * href: `/features/job-costing-reporting`
     * Under-button link:

       * Blue text link `text-[#0B5FFF] text-sm font-medium hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 rounded`
       * Text: “Start Free →”
       * href: signup route

9. Final CTA band:

   * Full-width `bg-[#0E2A47] text-white`
   * Wrapper: `max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 sm:py-16 text-center`
   * Heading: “Your crew can start using this today.”
   * Subtext: “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees. Works with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar. Start free and see it on your own phone.”
   * CTA row:

     * Primary button (blue #0B5FFF) “Start Free”
     * Secondary outline “View Pricing”
   * TCPA line under in `text-[11px] text-white/60 mt-2`:
     “By starting, you agree to receive onboarding and service-related messages. Standard rates apply for SMS usage.”

10. Accessibility:

* H1 only appears in Section 1.
* All other section titles are `<h2>`.
* Icons have `aria-hidden="true"`.
* Buttons and interactive links have visible focus rings as described.
* Maintain WCAG AA contrast from your Pro-Blueprint guidelines.

11. Messaging to repeat consistently:

* “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”
* “Works with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.”
* “No clipboards. No ‘text me the address.’”
  These phrases must appear exactly as written.

12. Do not alter global nav/footer or hero carousel logic from other pages. This page is standalone under `/features/work-orders-mobile`.

After Replit implements this page, you’ll have:

* `/features/scheduling-dispatch`
* `/features/work-orders-mobile`

Both built in the same system.
Next page after this will be **Estimates & Quotes** unless you want to jump to Billing/Payments.
