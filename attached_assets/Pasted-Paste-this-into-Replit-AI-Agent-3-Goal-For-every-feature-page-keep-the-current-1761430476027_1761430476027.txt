Paste this into Replit AI Agent 3.

## Goal

For **every feature page**, keep the current high-converting landing layout and generate **one high-quality AI image per page** that delivers a strong “that’s me at work” reaction. Use that single image as:

* The **hero** visual.
* A **subtle blurred backdrop** for one mid-page section (CSS overlay).
* A **small thumb** for related cards (auto-cropped).

Mobile-first. Sharp corners. AA contrast. No horizontal scroll at 375px. Rectangular bold buttons. Sticky bottom CTA + inline lead form on every page. Do not change copy structure. Only add the new single-image workflow.

## Section order (unchanged per page)

1. Hero band (Title, Subtitle, 3 KPI tiles, CTAs, single hero image)
2. What it does (3 bullets)
3. Why teams switch (Pain → Solve)
4. How it works (3 steps)
5. In the field (testimonial)
6. Works with (integrations)
7. Mini demo + lead capture
8. Related features (use the same one image as a 1:1 thumb)
9. FAQ
10. Bottom CTA band
11. Sticky bottom CTA

## Image rules (applies to every page)

* **Exactly one AI-generated image per feature page.**
* **No screens. No UI. No readable phones/tablets/laptops/monitors.** If a device appears, its screen is off or out of frame.
* Documentary jobsite style. Natural light. 24–70mm look. Slightly warm. Moderate contrast. OSHA-safe PPE. Tight crop on hands, tools, vehicles, environments. No third-party logos.
* Output: AVIF + WebP + JPEG at **1600 / 1200 / 768 / 480** widths, plus **LQIP 20px blur**. Provide alt text (role + task + context) and a short caption (≤80 chars).
* Save to `/public/images/{slug}/hero.*` and return a manifest object per page with `srcsets`, `alt`, `caption`.

## Placement

* **Hero:** place the single image full-bleed in the hero, left/top on mobile, side-by-side with KPIs/CTAs on desktop.
* **Backdrop reuse:** apply a soft, low-opacity, blurred version behind **“How it works”** or **“Pain → Solve”** using CSS overlay (no readability loss).
* **Related:** auto-generate a centered 1:1 crop for the related feature card.

## Per-feature single-image prompts

Use the “No-Screens Documentary Macro” + the specific prompt below.
**No-Screens Documentary Macro:**
“{TRADE}, {ACTION}, {ENVIRONMENT DETAILS}, **no screens visible**, documentary jobsite, natural light, shallow depth, moderate contrast, PPE correct, tight crop on hands/tools/vehicle, 35mm composition.”

## Implementation

1. For each `slug`, generate the single image using its prompt + the **No-Screens Documentary Macro**.
2. Export AVIF/WebP/JPEG at 1600/1200/768/480 + LQIP; save to `/public/images/{slug}/hero.*`.
3. Return a manifest per page:

```json
{
  "slug": "drag-and-drop-scheduling",
  "hero": {
    "alt": "HVAC tech reviewing printed route sheet in service van.",
    "caption": "Morning dispatch before first stop.",
    "srcset": {
      "avif": ["/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-480.avif","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-768.avif","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-1200.avif","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-1600.avif"],
      "webp": ["/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-480.webp","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-768.webp","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-1200.webp","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-1600.webp"],
      "jpeg": ["/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-480.jpg","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-768.jpg","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-1200.jpg","/public/images/drag-and-drop-scheduling/hero-1600.jpg"]
    },
    "lqip": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
  }
}
```

4. Wire each page to use the new hero image in the hero, apply a blurred overlay reuse behind one mid-page section, and auto-crop a 1:1 center thumbnail for “Related features”.
