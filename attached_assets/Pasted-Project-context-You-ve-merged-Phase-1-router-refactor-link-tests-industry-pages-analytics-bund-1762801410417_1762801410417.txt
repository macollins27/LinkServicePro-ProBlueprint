Project context

You’ve merged Phase-1 (router refactor, link tests, industry pages, analytics, bundlewatch). Marketing now needs scalable content architecture, localized lead funnels, and automated SEO hygiene ahead of paid/organic campaigns.

Phase-2 goal

Launch a content engine that lets non-devs add industry, geo, and educational pages with zero code changes while keeping page-speed, schema, and design consistency.

Scope of work

Headless content layer (MDX + Contentlayer)

Install Contentlayer; configure to ingest content/{blog,guide,case-study,geo,industry}/*.mdx.

Define types (BlogPost, Guide, CaseStudy, GeoPage, IndustryPage) with front-matter (title, slug, description, keywords, heroImage, publishDate, readTime, industry, city, state, metrics).

Add MDX components mapping (<Callout>, <KPIChip>, <Image>, <Video>).

Dynamic routing & static generation

Replace the hardcoded /industry/:slug route with file-system routing: auto-generate pages for each MDX file.

Create a geo-page template (/us/[state]/[city]/field-service-software) pulling from GeoPage content and injecting local schema LocalBusiness.

Ensure incremental static regeneration (ISR) with a 24-hour revalidate.

Automated sitemap & RSS

On build, generate /sitemap.xml and /rss.xml from Contentlayer documents; include lastMod and changefreq.

Schema & meta automation

Add SeoHead component that:

Injects OpenGraph, Twitter cards.

Generates JSON-LD (Article, SoftwareApplication, HowTo, VideoObject, LocalBusiness) based on document type.

Validate with Jest snapshot tests (seo-schema.test.tsx).

Pillar-cluster navigation

Component <RelatedPosts> that selects 3 pieces sharing the same industry or topicCluster front-matter.

Add at end of every Blog/Guide page.

Image optimization

Install vite-imagetools; convert imported images to AVIF/WebP, lazy-load, and set fetchpriority="high" for hero.

Live chat & AI phone widget embed

Add script tags from process.env.CHAT_WIDGET_URL & PHONE_WIDGET_URL in Layout.tsx.

Feature-flag via PUBLIC_ENABLE_CHAT env var.

Performance guardrails

Extend bundlewatch to track CLS, LCP, FID budgets from Lighthouse CI (mobile, slow-4G). Fail build if:

LCP > 3.0 s

CLS > 0.1

FID > 100 ms

CMS hand-off docs

Create docs/content-authoring.md explaining folder structure, front-matter fields, image guidelines, and markdown shortcodes.

Deliverables

Passing CI (unit, e2e, lighthouse, bundlewatch, SEO snapshots).

At least 3 blog posts, 1 pillar guide, 1 new case study, and 2 geo pages committed as examples.

Updated README.md with yarn add:post, yarn add:geo, and .env.example keys.

Commands & tooling
# add new content
yarn add:post "5 Hacks to Cut Dispatch Time"
yarn add:geo "Tampa" "FL"

# dev

# build & test

Start by scaffolding the Contentlayer config and migrating existing Industry MDX. Ping me in the PR if any assumptions need clarification.
