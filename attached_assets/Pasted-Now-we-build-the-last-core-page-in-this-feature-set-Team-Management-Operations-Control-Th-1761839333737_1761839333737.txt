Now we build the last core page in this feature set: **Team Management & Operations Control**.

This page is for owners, ops managers, and dispatchers who are juggling multiple techs/crews/crews+subs. The pain we’re solving: “I’m doing everyone’s job for them,” “no one is accountable,” “I can’t trust the team without being on-site,” “I’m the bottleneck.”

Search intent to capture:

* “field service team management software”
* “assign jobs to technicians”
* “track technician performance”
* “role-based permissions field service”
* “field service task assignments”
* “crew management app”

We’re going to frame it as: control, visibility, accountability, without micromanaging every move.

Same structure style:

* Dark hero
* Spotlight cards with PlanRibbon
* Light/dark alternation
* CTA every section
* Strong internal links to Scheduling & Dispatch, Work Orders & Mobile, and Job Costing & Reporting

## A. PAGE SPEC: Team Management & Operations Control

ROUTE / SLUG
`/features/team-management`

META

* `<title>`: “Team Management & Operations Control | Assign, Track, and Hold Techs Accountable”
* `<meta name="description">`: “Assign work, set expectations, track task completion, and control permissions without babysitting. Dispatch board, messaging, wage tracking, and job history — all in one system.”

PRIMARY SEO INTENT

* “field service team management”
* “assign work orders to technicians”
* “track technician performance”
* “manager to tech task assignment”
* “field service role-based permissions”

H1 (hero heading)
“Your team is accountable — without you standing over them.”

Hero Subhead
“Assign work. Give instructions. See what got done. Track performance and profitability by tech. All with clear roles and permissions so the wrong people can’t touch the wrong things.”

CORE MESSAGE TO HAMMER:

* You stop being the single point of control.
* Techs know exactly what to do.
* Managers can manage.
* You get a record of who did what and how well.

PAGE STRUCTURE (4 sections + final CTA band)

1. HERO (dark navy brand)
2. ASSIGN & HOLD ACCOUNTABLE (tasking / roles / internal messaging)
3. DISPATCH & FIELD EXECUTION (tech sees job, captures proof)
4. PERFORMANCE & CONTROL (visibility, permissions, wage tracking, audit trail)
5. FINAL CTA BAND

We’re going to pull features from:

* Multi-user support with manager roles
* Task management system
* Manager-to-employee task assignments
* Internal employee messaging
* Dispatch board for technicians
* Project tracking with multiple work orders
* Payroll & wage tracking
* Advanced role-based permissions
* Audit logs
* SLA policies / priority queues / escalations (enterprise-tier hooks)

We'll also make sure we tie back to profitability and field execution so AI and Google understand how the feature ecosystem connects.

## B. REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION BLOCK

Paste this block directly into Replit. Do not paraphrase:

1. Create a new page component at `/features/team-management` using the exact same Next.js / Tailwind / shadcn/ui conventions as previous feature pages. Keep global header/footer untouched.

2. Add `<Head>` with:

   ```html
   <title>Team Management & Operations Control | Assign, Track, and Hold Techs Accountable</title>
   <meta name="description" content="Assign work, set expectations, track task completion, and control permissions without babysitting. Dispatch board, messaging, wage tracking, and job history — all in one system." />
   ```

   Add JSON-LD structured data of type `SoftwareApplication`:

   * name: "LinkServicePro Team Management & Operations Control"
   * applicationCategory: "Field service management software"
   * offers.description: "Start free. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."

     * Secondary outline (border-white/30): “View Pricing”
   * TCPA line:
     “By starting, you agree to receive onboarding and service-related messages. Standard rates apply for SMS usage.”

4. Component / accessibility requirements (MUST follow same rules as all previous feature pages):

   * Spotlight card wrapper class:
     `relative bg-white ring-1 ring-slate-200 rounded-xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition duration-150 ease-out motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:transform-none motion-reduce:hover:shadow-sm p-5`
   * `<PlanRibbon plan="..."/>` positioned `absolute -top-2 -right-2 z-20`
   * Eyebrow chip pill above each spotlight card headline
   * Bullet rows = icon `text-[#0B5FFF] w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0 aria-hidden="true"` + text block:

     * Title: `text-sm font-medium text-slate-700`
     * Support: `text-[13px] text-slate-500 leading-snug`
   * Inline plan chips for feature tier:
     `inline-block bg-slate-200 text-slate-700 text-[10px] font-medium rounded-full px-1.5 py-[1px] ml-2`
   * Outcome Rows (right columns where specified) are NOT cards.
   * All interactive elements (`button`, link-like CTAs) MUST include:
     `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none`
   * Only the hero headline is `<h1>`. All subsequent major section headlines are `<h2>`.
   * Maintain WCAG AA contrast. Dark trust blocks use `bg-slate-900 text-white`, etc.

5. Mandatory internal links:

   * “See Work Orders & Mobile →” → `/features/work-orders-mobile`
   * “See Scheduling & Dispatch” → `/features/scheduling-dispatch`
   * “See Profit Reporting” → `/features/job-costing-reporting`
   * “View Pricing” → pricing route
     These links must exist with exactly those labels.

6. The following phrases MUST appear exactly on the page:

   * “Your team is accountable — without you standing over them.”
   * “Tell them exactly what to do today.”
   * “Everyone knows where to be and what to do.”
   * “Fewer ‘what next?’ phone calls.”
   * “See who’s profitable — and protect what matters.”
   * “You stop being the bottleneck.”
   * “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”

When you ship this page, you’ve now covered every core buying objection:

* “Can I dispatch?” (Scheduling & Dispatch)
* “Will my guys actually use it?” (Work Orders & Mobile)
* “Will it help me sell?” (Estimates & Quotes)
* “Will it help me get paid?” (Invoicing & Payments)
* “Can I build recurring revenue?” (Maintenance Plans)
* “Will I know my real profit?” (Job Costing & Reporting)
* “Can I control my team without losing my mind?” (Team Management & Operations Control)

At this point, you have a fully mapped feature library that is internally linked, SEO-structured, conversion-driven, and consistent with your brand voice: professional, no fluff, honest about pain.

Your next step after this is pricing page and comparison page, unless you want me to help you with Terms / Privacy / SLA / TCPA copy.
