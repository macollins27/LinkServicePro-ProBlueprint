Above the fold

Single CTA. Pick “Start Free Trial” or “Book a Demo.” Secondary becomes link. Split attention lowers clicks.

Hero copy weight. Trim subhead to one sentence. Add one quantified proof (e.g., “save 6–10 hrs/week”).

Trust row. Add 4–6 recognizable logos. Ratings need a source link.

Navigation

Menu affordance. Add chevrons on Features/Industries/Resources. Expand on focus + hover. ESC closes.

Scan blocks (pillars)

Card contrast. Increase text contrast; current gray-on-gray is borderline. Use #111827 on light cards.

Clickable area. Make whole card clickable. Add right-arrow affordance.

Order. Put “Work Smarter” before “Win More Jobs” if scheduling is your core hook.

Scheduling & Dispatch section

Visual proof. Add one micro-metric row: “-18% drive time,” “+1.3 jobs/tech/day.” Even if placeholder, format now.

Mock alignment. Center the route mock; current looks light and small. Use 560–640px width on desktop.

Quote → Work Order → Invoice

Reduce chrome. Panels look like empty app windows. Replace with large icons + three bullets each.

Add “Get paid” proof. “Deposits and partials supported.” “Avg. days-to-paid ↓.”

Customer experience section

Social proof. Move the testimonial to the left of bullets. Add headshot or logo.

Messaging clarity. Label “2-Way SMS/Email” as “Text and email customers from the job screen” to remove jargon.

Projects & Job Costing

KPI alignment. Use equal widths. Ensure currency formatting consistent. Add small trend arrows.

Explain projects. One line: “Group multiple visits, docs, and invoices under one project.”

Industries grid

CTA. Each tile gets “See workflows” not “See how it works.” Stronger intent.

Integrations

Logos > pills. Use logos with one-line benefit. Add “View all integrations →”.

Accounting first. QuickBooks/Xero top-left. PropertyLinkWare group second.

Pricing teaser

Clarity. Add “Sign Up for Free. No card.” 

Anchor links. Buttons to #pricing, #faq. Include “Compare plans” link.

Trust & security

Real claims only. If SOC2 isn’t complete, switch to “SOC2 in progress.” Add data encryption, uptime %, and link to status page.

FAQ

Expand/collapse icons. Use +/– with clear focus states. Allow deep link to each item via id.

Footer

Contact info. Add phone and support hours. Add company address or city/state.

Legal. Add Privacy, Terms, Cookies.

Accessibility

Focus states. High-contrast outlines on links, buttons, menu items.

Landmarks. Use <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>. One H1 per page.

Alt text. Real descriptions for field images. No “image-1.”

Reduced motion. Disable autoplay when prefers-reduced-motion is on.

Performance/SEO

CLS. Set width/height on all images and icons. Use loading="lazy" below the fold.

Fonts. Use system stack or font-display: swap. Keep CSS < 80KB.

Meta. Title ≤60 chars. Meta description 150–160 chars. Canonical tag.

Schema. Add JSON-LD for Organization, Website, Product (with offers placeholder).

Analytics. Data attributes on CTAs: data-cta="hero-start-trial", etc.

Forms

Demo modal. Name, email, phone, company size, industry, timeline. Inline validation. Privacy note under button.

Newsletter. Clarify value: “Monthly tips and templates.” Checkbox for consent if required.

Micro-UI

Underline hover. Keep right→left draw. Add :focus-visible to match.

Buttons. Sharp corners already fine. Add press state (2px translateY).

Icons. Use a consistent set. Size 20–24px. Left of headlines in feature cards.

Content

Voice. Short, active sentences. Benefit first. No jargon.

Proof. At least one metric in first screen. Add two short case snippets by industry under grid.
