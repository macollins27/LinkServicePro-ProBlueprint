Great. We’re moving on to **Estimates & Quotes**.

This page is for money at the front of the job: capturing the lead, pricing the job, getting a signature, and moving straight into scheduled work. This is one of the highest-intent searches (“field service estimating software,” “HVAC quote app”) so this page must feel revenue-focused, fast, and professional.

Same flow:

* Part A: Page spec (content + layout)
* Part B: Replit implementation instructions (what you paste into Replit as-is)

We keep all design rules we’ve already committed to: alternating backgrounds, spotlight cards with PlanRibbon, CTA in every section, unlimited-users messaging, mobile-first, accessible focus rings, professional/no-gimmick tone.

## B. REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

Here’s what you’ll paste into Replit:

1. Create a new page component `/features/estimates-quotes` using our Next.js/React conventions and the same design system we used for `/features/scheduling-dispatch` and `/features/work-orders-mobile`. Do NOT modify nav, footer, or global layout.

2. Head/meta for SEO:

   * `<title>Field Service Estimating Software | Digital Quotes with E-Signatures</title>`
   * `<meta name="description" content="Send clean professional estimates, get signatures on the spot, and instantly convert approvals into scheduled jobs. Automated follow-ups, lead tracking, and zero chasing. Unlimited users on paid plans." />`
   * Inject JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication`:

     * name: "LinkServicePro Estimates & Quotes"
     * applicationCategory: "Field service management software"
     * offers.description: "Start free. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."

3. Build all 5 sections in this exact order and style:

   SECTION 1. HERO (bg-[#0E2A47] text-white)

   * Two-column grid on desktop, stacked on mobile.
   * Left side: eyebrow chip “Estimates & Quotes”, H1 “Send a quote. Get it signed. Book the job.”, subhead, KPI-style value row, pill badges, CTA buttons (“Start Free” + “See Quote Flow”), reassurance line.
   * Right side: placeholder “Estimate Preview” mock card (white/5 background, border-white/10, rounded-xl, min-h-[260px]) that shows fake estimate header, gray bars as line items, caption “Line items • Total • Signature box • Approve now”.

   SECTION 2. FAST, PROFESSIONAL ESTIMATES (bg-white)

   * Two-column grid.
   * Left column: Spotlight Card with PlanRibbon plan="Free / Starter".

     * Card headline “Look legit, even if you’re a two-person crew.”
     * Bullets for Quote creation & tracking, Digital signatures, Deposits & partial payments.
     * CTA: “Generate My First Quote” (blue primary) and “Start Free →” (blue link).
   * Right column: Outcome rows (not cards). 3 rows:

     * “No more spreadsheet math.”
     * “No more sloppy texts.”
     * “Price with confidence.”
       Then a blue link: “See Invoicing & Payments →” linking `/features/invoicing-payments`.

   SECTION 3. FOLLOW-UP & PIPELINE (bg-slate-50)

   * Two-column grid.
   * Left column: h2 “Stop losing work just because you forgot to follow up.”

     * Bullets for Lead management & pipeline, Automated follow-ups, See who went cold.
     * Each bullet includes a tiny inline plan chip (Starter+ / Essential+ for SMS where relevant).
     * CTA buttons: “See Pipeline View” (blue) and “Start Free →” (link).
   * Right column: Spotlight Card with PlanRibbon plan="Starter+".

     * Eyebrow chip “Pipeline & Follow-up”
     * Headline “You don’t have time to babysit leads.”
     * Body copy and gray placeholder board mock (bg-slate-100 rounded-lg h-32 w-full mt-4 ... "Pipeline / Hot / Waiting Signature / Won / Lost")
     * CTA small row: button “See Quote Flow”, link “Compare Plans →”.

   SECTION 4. CONVERT TO SCHEDULED JOB (bg-white)

   * Two-column grid.
   * Left column: Spotlight Card with PlanRibbon plan="Free → Starter".

     * Eyebrow chip “Quote → Scheduled Job”
     * Headline “When they say yes, you’re already booked.”
     * Bullets:

       * “Push approved estimate straight into dispatch”
       * “Tie that job to work orders, materials, and invoicing”
       * “See status from estimate → scheduled → completed → paid”
     * CTA block:

       * Primary button: “See Scheduling & Dispatch” linking `/features/scheduling-dispatch`
       * Secondary link under: “Start Free →”
   * Right column: Outcome rows (not cards). 3 rows:

     * “No double entry.”
     * “No lost details.”
     * “Less back-and-forth.”
       Then link: “See Work Orders & Mobile →” linking `/features/work-orders-mobile`.

   SECTION 5. FINAL CTA BAND (bg-[#0E2A47] text-white)

   * Centered content, max-w-3xl.
   * Heading: “Start winning jobs faster.”
   * Subtext: “Send professional quotes. Get signatures instantly. Auto-follow up. Push approved work straight onto the schedule. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”
   * CTA row:

     * Primary button (blue #0B5FFF): “Start Free”
     * Secondary outline (border-white/30): “View Pricing”
   * TCPA line under: “By starting, you agree to receive onboarding and service-related messages. Standard rates apply for SMS usage.”
   * Buttons and links MUST include keyboard focus rings:
     `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none`

4. Styling / components:

   * Spotlight cards reuse the same container class you used on previous feature pages (relative bg-white ring-1 ring-slate-200 rounded-xl shadow-sm ...).
   * Each Spotlight card must include `<PlanRibbon plan="..."/>` in the top-right corner; absolute positioned with `-top-2 -right-2`.
   * Each Spotlight card must include an eyebrow chip pill above headline.
   * All bullet rows are icon + text. Icons must be relevant (FileText, Edit3/Pen, Handshake or Signature, DollarSign/Receipt, etc.). Do NOT reuse the same icon for every bullet.
   * Icons should be `aria-hidden="true"`.

5. Accessibility & semantics:

   * H1 only appears in Section 1.
   * All other section headings use `<h2>`.
   * Maintain WCAG AA contrast (dark navy with white text is fine, light gray bg-slate-50 with slate-900 text is fine).
   * All CTAs have visible focus rings exactly like previous pages.
   * All interactive links that look like CTAs must have `hover:underline` and the focus-visible ring.

6. Critical messaging that MUST appear exactly as written:

   * “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”
   * “Stop chasing people for approval.”
   * “They sign with a finger.”
   * “When they say yes, you’re already booked.”
   * These are positioning hooks. Do not soften them.

7. Internal linking:

   * Link from this Estimates & Quotes page to:

     * `/features/invoicing-payments` (“See Invoicing & Payments →” in Section 2)
     * `/features/scheduling-dispatch` (“See Scheduling & Dispatch” in Section 4 card CTA)
     * `/features/work-orders-mobile` (“See Work Orders & Mobile →” Section 4 right column)
       These cross-links are required.

8. After building this page, expose it in any “Generate My First Quote,” “Estimate & Sign,” or “Quote Flow” CTAs throughout the site.

If implemented exactly, `/features/estimates-quotes` will:

* Speak directly to revenue and speed (what the owner actually cares about).
* Feel professional, not scammy.
* Reinforce your differentiators (unlimited users, no per-tech fees).
* Internally link to Dispatch, Mobile App, and Payments so Google and AI both understand you’re a full platform, not a point tool.

Next page after this is **Invoicing & Payments** unless you want to jump ahead.
