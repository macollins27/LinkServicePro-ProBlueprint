## Global Goal

Apply the **high-converting feature landing** template and **AI-generated, field-authentic imagery** to **every Features page**. Keep the same layout and behavior you built for Scheduling. Mobile-first, sharp corners, AA contrast, no horizontal scroll at 375px. Each section starts with **Title + Subtitle** top-left. Rectangular bold buttons. Sticky bottom CTA + inline lead form on every page.

You will:

1. Use one **Feature Landing Template** for all pages.
2. Populate content from the **Per-Feature Content Map** below.
3. **AI-generate images** per page using the **Image Macro** and **Per-Feature Image Sets**.
4. Wire images per the **Placement Map**.
5. Ship pages for all slugs listed.

**Placement Map (all pages)**

* **Hero**: vertical carousel 3 images (mobile 4:5, desktop 16:10).
* **What it does**: 1 image right of bullets (above on mobile).

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data**: Create/extend `src/data/features.json` with each feature’s: `slug, name, cluster, subtitle, kpis, bullets, pains, solves, steps, testimonial, integrations, related, faqs`.
2. **Images**: For each `slug`, generate the **10-image minimum** using the prompts above (apply the **Image Macro**). Save under `/public/images/{slug}/…`. Produce a JSON manifest with alt, caption, and srcsets.
3. **Template**: Ensure every page uses the common Feature Landing Template and pulls copy + image manifest by `slug`.
4. **Placement**: Wire images according to the **Placement Map**. Use AVIF/WebP/JPEG with `srcset` and LQIP; hero images not lazy; others lazy.
5. **QA**: Mobile at 375px; keyboard and screen-reader checks on FAQ and buttons; Lighthouse ≥90/≥95; CLS <0.05.
6. **Output**: Return a table listing each slug with the generated filenames for: `hero[3], what, pain, solve, step1, step2, step3, testimonial, demo, related[3]`.
