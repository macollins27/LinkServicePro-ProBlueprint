You’re right—let’s give this section a distinctive, premium feel without noise. Here’s a redesigned block that reads fast, contrasts cleanly with the dark hero, and feels “custom”: a **Workflow Rail**—three connected steps with a subtle blue rail running behind the cards. It’s calm, unique, and every card has a CTA.

---

## Create “Workflow Rail” section (unique, high-contrast, premium)

**Scope:** Add this directly under the hero. Do not change the hero or the carousel.

### Visual concept

* **Background:** very light blue-tinted white for hard contrast with the dark hero: `#F7FAFF`.
* **Motif:** a soft **blue rail line** (SVG) runs behind all cards from left to right, hinting “one connected flow.”
* **Cards:** white surfaces with crisp borders, subtle shadow, and a **large step number watermark** in the corner (faint, not gimmicky).
* **Hierarchy:** center card lifted by 4px to draw the eye without flash.
* **CTAs:** a primary button on each card + a section-level CTA below.

### Colors

* Rail gradient: `#9CC0FF → #2D6BFF`
* Card border: `#E6EAF2`
* Headings: `#0A1326`
* Body text: `#1F2937`
* Primary button: `#2D6BFF` hover `#255AE0`

### Copy (plain language, no abbreviations)

* Title: **Everything you need in one place**
* Subtitle: *Plan the day, send estimates, and collect payments without switching tools.*
* Card 1 — **Schedule and dispatch**

  * Intro: *Assign jobs to the right person in minutes.*
  * Bullets:

    * *Drag and drop jobs onto the schedule.*
    * *Match by skills, distance, and priority.*
    * *Give every technician the plan on their phone.*
  * CTA: **See scheduling** → `/features/scheduling`
* Card 2 — **Send estimates and get approval**

  * Intro: *Create clear estimates on site or in the office.*
  * Bullets:

    * *Use saved items and prices to build fast.*
    * *Send by email and text with one click.*
    * *Customers approve online without a call.*
  * CTA: **See estimates** → `/features/estimates`
* Card 3 — **Invoice and get paid**

  * Intro: *Create an invoice and collect payment the same day.*
  * Bullets:

    * *Accept cards and bank payments securely.*
    * *Send receipts and keep records in one place.*
    * *Track what is due and what is paid.*
  * CTA: **See payments** → `/features/payments`
* Section CTA: **Start your trial** → `/signup`

### Accessibility

* `<section aria-labelledby="workflow-rail-title">`
* Rail is decorative `aria-hidden="true"`.
* Buttons have visible focus rings.

### Why this cures the “bare minimum” problem

* **Contrast is automatic:** light band under a dark hero; black-on-white text inside cards.
* **Distinctive but calm:** the rail and watermark numerals add identity without clutter.
* **Conversion-first:** CTA on each card plus a bottom CTA.
* **Professional details:** precise borders, subtle lift, center-card emphasis.

Drop this in and we’ll tune spacing if needed. After this section is approved, we can mirror the rail motif in a compact “Old way vs. LinkServicePro” band to deepen differentiation while keeping the same visual language.
