Goal: Convert ALL feature pages to a single data-driven template with consistent IA, copy blocks, buttons, SEO, a11y, and sticky CTA. Replace per-page bespoke code with a shared FeatureLayout + content config. Keep Pro-Blueprint theme and standardized buttons.

Scope:
- Routes under /features: drag-and-drop-scheduling, dispatch-board, route-optimization, real-time-gps, capacity-planning, automated-reminders, recurring-jobs, crm-leads, quote-esign, work-orders, project-tracking, customer-portal, two-way-messaging, review-requests, invoicing, payments, deposits, job-costing, payroll, vendors-pos, accounting-sync.
- If a slug doesn’t exist yet, scaffold it.

Do:
1) Create shared layout + sections
   Files:
   - src/features/FeatureLayout.tsx
     Renders in order (all optional via flags):
       Hero
       InstantDemo (optional)
       PainSolve
       HowItWorks3
       ProofFAQ
       MiniDemoLead
       IntegrationsStrip
       RelatedFeatures3
       BottomCTABand
       StickyBottomCTA
     Accepts a `FeatureSpec` object (see below). Import standardized buttons from src/components/Buttons.tsx. Mobile-first. WCAG AA+. Sharp corners only.

   - src/features/sections/{Hero.tsx, InstantDemo.tsx, PainSolve.tsx, HowItWorks3.tsx, ProofFAQ.tsx, MiniDemoLead.tsx, IntegrationsStrip.tsx, RelatedFeatures3.tsx, BottomCTABand.tsx, StickyBottomCTA.tsx}
     Reuse the working Scheduling versions as baselines. Parameterize all copy via props. Remove hard-coded strings. Keep analytics hooks. Keep JSON-LD emission inside Hero (SoftwareApplication) and ProofFAQ (FAQPage) when provided.

2) Define typed content config
   - src/features/spec.ts
     ```ts
     export type FeatureSpec = {
       slug: string;
       title: string;                 // H1/Hero
       subtitle: string;              // hero sub
       heroImage?: string;            // documentary image path
       outcomes: string[];            // 2–3 plain-language benefits
       showInstantDemo?: boolean;
       pains?: string[];              // up to 6
       solves?: string[];             // up to 6, aligned by index
       steps?: {title:string;desc:string}[]; // 3 steps
       testimonial?: { quote:string; by:string; chips:string[] };
       faq?: { q:string; a:string }[];
       related?: { slug:string; title:string }[];
       seo: { title:string; description:string; canonical?:string };
       schemaFeatureList?: string[];
       ctas?: { primaryText?: "Start Free"; secondaryText?: "View Pricing" };
     }
     ```

   - src/features/content.ts
     Export a `FEATURES: Record<string, FeatureSpec>` containing an entry for each slug. Seed “drag-and-drop-scheduling” using the current approved copy. For other features, provide placeholder documentary-safe copy following Global Content Rules:
       outcomes: ["Stops double-booking","Reschedule in seconds","Instant auto-texts"] for scheduling; vary appropriately for others.
       steps pattern: “Add job” → “Assign” → “Customer gets ETA” or relevant variant.
       testimonial + faq: reuse scheduling patterns with wording adjusted to the feature.
       seo.title format: “<Feature> • Field Service Software”
       seo.description ≤160 chars, benefit-first.

3) Generate routes
   - Modify src/routes/features/[slug].tsx (or create per-route files) to:
     ```tsx
     import { FeatureLayout } from "@/features/FeatureLayout";
     import { FEATURES } from "@/features/content";
     export default function FeatureRoute(){ const spec = FEATURES["<slug>"]; return <FeatureLayout spec={spec}/> }
     ```
   - Add a small router factory `src/routes/features/index.tsx` that reads the `FEATURES` map and exports a mapping for Wouter. Ensure canonical paths `/features/<slug>` exist.

4) Standardize buttons site-wide
   - Confirm all feature sections call:
     import { StartFreeButton, ViewPricingButton, ButtonsRow } from "@/components/Buttons";
     Use `context="dark"` in dark hero, `context="light"` elsewhere. Remove any ad-hoc buttons.

5) Remove duplication
   - Delete bespoke per-page copies of PainSolve/FAQ/etc. Move any experimental sections to `src/sections/labs/` and exclude from routes.

6) Analytics + SEO
   - In FeatureLayout:
     * Fire `page_view` with `{ page: spec.slug }`.
     * Normalize CTA events with `placement` including slug.
   - Inject JSON-LD SoftwareApplication on feature pages using `schemaFeatureList` and a free Offer price=0. Inject FAQPage when `spec.faq` exists.

7) A11y + QA gates (enforce)
   - 375px: no horizontal overflow.
   - Visible focus ring #0B5FFF with 2px offset (white on light, #0F2033 on dark).
   - Accordion roles correct. aria-live regions announce once.
   - Lighthouse thresholds: ≥90 Performance, ≥95 Accessibility for one exemplar page per group; fix regressions globally.

8) Build helpers
   - Add `scripts/check-features.ts` that:
     * Ensures each slug in FEATURES has a route file and is linked from /features hub.
     * Prints missing images.
   - Add basic tests with data-testid on each section root: feature-hero, instant-demo, pain-solve, how-steps, proof-faq, mini-demo-lead, integrations-strip, related-features, bottom-cta, sticky-cta.

9) Migrate current scheduling page to the template
   - Create a `FeatureSpec` for “drag-and-drop-scheduling” using the already approved copy and images.
   - Render it through FeatureLayout. Remove old one-off route composition.

Acceptance:
- All feature pages render through FeatureLayout with data from FEATURES.
- Buttons follow the standardized spec.
- JSON-LD present where applicable.
- No duplicate bespoke sections remain.
- 375px has no overflow. Keyboard nav clean.
- Lighthouse meets thresholds on /features/drag-and-drop-scheduling and two other feature pages.
