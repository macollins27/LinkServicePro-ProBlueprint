Perfect—let’s pivot to a **clean comparison table** that communicates the value at a glance. Here’s a **single, surgical, no-code prompt** for Replit Agent 3 to replace the five cards with a **competitor comparison matrix** that’s fast to scan, mobile-first, accessible, and legally careful.

---

**Task:** Replace the current “Why Teams Switch to LinkServicePro” cards with a **comparison matrix**: competitors (rows) vs. capabilities/outcomes (columns). Use concise check/partial/x states with icons and color (green/amber/red), plus short tooltips for clarity. Keep it mobile-first, AA accessible, and performance-friendly. No changes outside this band.

### 0) Placement & scope

* Same section position (right after Industries).
* Use existing design tokens (colors, spacing, typography). No global refactors.

### 1) Framing & copy (top of section)

* Eyebrow: **Why Teams Switch**
* H2: **See it in one table**
* Support line (one sentence): **“Where spreadsheets and multi-app stacks create retyping and delays, LinkServicePro keeps scheduling, quotes, invoices, and maintenance in one flow.”**
* Small legal note under the table: **“Based on publicly available info and customer feedback; features change over time.”**

### 2) Table content model (data-driven; no hardcoded markup here)

* **Rows (competitors):**

  * LinkServicePro (highlighted row, always first)
  * Spreadsheets (Excel/Sheets)
  * Legacy Desktop (generic)
  * 4-App Patchwork (generic stack)
  * Optional placeholders “Competitor A/B” (only if Product/Legal approves—otherwise hide)
* **Columns (capabilities/outcomes):** keep to **6–8 max** for clarity; group by flow:

  1. **Scheduling & Dispatch**
  2. **Estimates with e-sign**
  3. **Same-day invoicing & payments**
  4. **Recurring maintenance plans**
  5. **Single job timeline (photos/notes/signatures)**
  6. **Mobile app for crews**
  7. **Calendar sync (Google & Apple)**
  8. **Unlimited users on paid plans**
* **Cell states:**

  * **✓ (green)** = included / strong
  * **~ (amber)** = partial / workaround
  * **✕ (red)** = missing
  * Each cell also has a **short tooltip** (1 line) that explains the state (e.g., “Quotes convert to invoices in one click” vs “Manual copy/paste”).
  * Provide **sr-only text** mirroring the symbol + meaning for screen readers.
* **Optional “Cost drag” column** at the far right (desktop only): qualitative tag like *Seat-based*, *Multiple subscriptions*, *Time cost*. Tooltip required.

### 3) Visual & interaction spec

* **Desktop (lg+):**

  * 12-column section grid; table uses full width inside the container.
  * **Sticky header row** (columns) and **sticky first column** (competitor names) while horizontally scrolling if needed.
  * Highlight LinkServicePro row with a subtle band (not an aggressive color block).
  * Keep row height compact and **consistent**; text wraps to 2 lines max.
* **Mobile (default):**

  * Provide a **horizontal scroll** container with a visible gradient fade at both sides.
  * Keep the **first column sticky** so the user knows which row they’re viewing.
  * Add a quick **column picker** (multi-select) that defaults to 4–5 columns to reduce overload on small screens; selections update instantly.
  * When `prefers-reduced-motion`, disable any scroll-snap effects.
* **Color & icons:**

  * Use brand **green** for ✓, **amber** for ~, **red** for ✕.
  * Never rely on color alone—**pair each with an icon** and sr-only meaning.
  * Maintain AA contrast on the navy canvas.
* **Tooltips:**

  * Lightweight, focusable, and accessible (trigger via icon or cell; ESC to close; arrow keys cycle).
  * On touch, tap once to open, tap outside to dismiss.
* **Row actions:**

  * Each row (except LSP) includes a small **“What this means”** expander that reveals **two concise bullets** (e.g., for spreadsheets: “Manual copy/paste between steps” / “No single job timeline”). Expander is collapsed by default and keyboard-operable.

### 4) Accessibility requirements

* Semantic **table** with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th scope="col">`, `<th scope="row">`.
* Symbols must include **sr-only labels**: “Included,” “Partial,” “Missing.”
* Sticky header/first column must remain keyboard-reachable.
* Tooltips are announced via `aria-describedby` and are dismissible with ESC.
* Ensure **focus rings** on scrollable container, column picker, expanders, and CTAs.

### 5) Performance & SEO

* No third-party embeds.
* Fixed column widths to prevent layout shift; intrinsic sizing for icons.
* Lazy-render hidden expander content.
* Add **FAQPage JSON-LD** only if you add a small FAQ under the table; otherwise none.

### 6) Legal/comms guardrails

* Use **generic rows** (Spreadsheets, Legacy Desktop, 4-App Patchwork).
* Only include named competitors if Legal signs off; if not, hide those rows.
* Keep claims qualitative; avoid unverifiable absolute numbers.
* Include the “features change over time” note.

### 7) Controls & CTAs

* **Column picker** (mobile-friendly): checkboxes to show/hide columns; default to the most important 4–5.
* **Sticky mini-CTA** above the table on mobile: “Compare less—try it free.”
* **Primary CTA** below the table: **Get Started Free** → existing route.
* **Secondary CTA:** **Talk to an expert** → existing route.

### 8) Analytics

* Event `comparison.column_toggle` with column key(s).
* Event `comparison.row_expand` with row key.
* Event `comparison.cta_primary` / `comparison.cta_secondary`.

### 9) Acceptance criteria

1. Cards are **removed**; the matrix renders with **clear rows/columns** and readable states.
2. LinkServicePro row is highlighted but not shouty; symbols + color + tooltips make meaning obvious at a glance.
3. Mobile experience is **usable**: horizontal scroll with sticky first column, column picker, no overflow bugs.
4. A11y: proper table semantics, sr-only labels, focusable tooltips, ESC closes; contrast passes AA.
5. Performance: no CLS from the table; icons are lightweight; no third-party scripts.
6. Legal note is visible under the table.

### Suggested initial data (keep it editable; examples only)

* **Rows:** `linkservicepro`, `spreadsheets`, `legacy_desktop`, `four_app_stack`
* **Columns:** `dispatch`, `e_sign_quotes`, `same_day_invoicing`, `maintenance_plans`, `single_timeline`, `mobile_app`, `calendar_sync`, `unlimited_users`
* **States (example):**

  * LinkServicePro: ✓ on all eight.
  * Spreadsheets: ~ on dispatch (manual), ✕ on e-sign quotes, ✕ on same-day invoicing, ✕ maintenance, ✕ single timeline, ✕ mobile app, ~ calendar sync (manual), ✓ unlimited users.
  * Legacy Desktop: ✓ dispatch (office), ✕ e-sign quotes, ~ invoicing (batch), ✕ maintenance, ~ timeline (attachments later), ✕ mobile app, ✕ calendar sync, ~ users (seat-based).
  * 4-App Patchwork: ~ dispatch (separate app), ~ e-sign quotes (separate app), ~ invoicing (integration), ~ maintenance (separate), ✕ single timeline, ✓ mobile app (varies), ~ calendar sync (varies), ✕ unlimited users (seat-based).

If you’d like, I can also craft the exact tooltip lines for each cell so Replit can populate the dataset without improvising tone or claims.
