Good. We will build `/features/scheduling-dispatch` first.

You’re going to give this to Replit as an implementation prompt. The goal is to ship a production-quality, conversion-focused feature landing page that matches the visual language we’ve already established (Pro-Blueprint system, dark/light alternation, CTAs in every section, PlanRibbon badges, WCAG AA, mobile-first). The content below is the exact copy and section structure. Replit should not improvise or reword.

I’ll do two things:

1. Give you the final page structure and copy (the spec).
2. Give you the exact Replit instructions to build it.

You paste the Replit instructions (Section B) into Replit. Replit should create `/features/scheduling-dispatch.tsx` or similar, following your routing setup.

---

## A. PAGE SPEC: “Scheduling & Dispatch”

ROUTE / SLUG:
`/features/scheduling-dispatch`

META:

* `<title>`: “Scheduling & Dispatch Software | Drag-and-Drop, Route Optimization, GPS Tracking”
* `<meta name="description">`: “Assign jobs in seconds, balance routes, sync to Google and Apple Calendar, and see every tech live on the map. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”

ACCESSIBILITY / STYLE NOTES:

* This page must use the same Tailwind design system as the rest of the app (blue #0B5FFF CTA, dark navy #0E2A47 sections, bg-slate-50 alternation, ring-1 ring-slate-200 cards, etc).
* All CTA buttons must have proper `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2` so keyboard users can see focus.
* All ribbons must use the PlanRibbon component we already specced, positioned top-right of spotlight cards.
* All icons per bullet must use lucide-react icons (or whatever icon set you’re already using), sized ~20-24px, color `text-[#0B5FFF]`, and must NOT be all identical.

PAGE LAYOUT (4 major sections + final CTA band)

SECTION 1. HERO (dark navy)
Background: `bg-[#0E2A47] text-white`

Container utility:
`max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 sm:py-16 grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-10`

Left column (text block):

* Eyebrow chip (small pill):
  text: “Scheduling & Dispatch”
  classes example: `inline-block text-[11px] font-semibold text-white/80 bg-white/10 border border-white/20 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] mb-4`
* H1 (white, bold, large):
  “Drag-and-drop scheduling and live dispatch — without the chaos.”
* Subhead (white/80):
  “Assign jobs in seconds, balance workloads, sync every tech’s calendar, and cut wasted drive time. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”
* KPI row under subhead (flex wrap gap-3 mt-4 text-[13px] text-white/80):

  * “35% faster scheduling”
  * “2× quicker approvals”
  * “<24 hr average time-to-pay”
    Each KPI prefixed by a small check or trending-up icon in `text-[#0B5FFF]`.
* Badge row under KPIs (flex wrap gap-2 text-[11px] mt-4):
  Use pill chips `bg-white/10 border border-white/20 text-white font-medium rounded-full px-3 py-[3px]`:

  * “Works with Google Calendar”
  * “Works with Apple Calendar”
  * “No per-tech seat fees”
* CTA row:

  * Primary CTA button (blue bg #0B5FFF, white text, rounded-md, px-4 py-2 text-sm font-semibold shadow-sm; includes focus-visible ring):
    text: “Start Free”
  * Secondary CTA as bordered button (transparent bg, border border-white/30 text-white text-sm font-semibold rounded-md px-4 py-2 hover:bg-white/10):
    text: “View Live Dispatch Demo”
    Underneath in `text-[11px] text-white/60 mt-2`:
    “No credit card to start.”

Right column:

* A “Command Board Preview” card mock. This is NOT final product screenshots. It’s a styled placeholder so the layout looks complete.

  * Card styles: `relative bg-white/5 border border-white/10 rounded-xl shadow-inner p-4 min-h-[220px] flex flex-col justify-between`
  * Title row inside placeholder (white text, text-sm font-semibold):
    “Today’s Dispatch Board”
  * Gray boxes representing tech rows / route cards (simple divs `bg-white/10 rounded-md h-4 w-full mb-2` etc.)
  * Bottom caption in `text-[11px] text-white/60`:
    “Live map • Crew availability • Route load per tech”

There must be no carousel here. This hero stands alone.

SECTION 2. “The Command Board”
Background: white (`bg-white text-slate-900`)

Container utility:
`max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 sm:py-16 grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-10`

Left column: Spotlight Card

* Outer card:
  `relative bg-white ring-1 ring-slate-200 rounded-xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition duration-150 ease-out motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:transform-none motion-reduce:hover:shadow-sm p-5`
* Insert `<PlanRibbon plan="Starter+" />` in top-right corner of this card. It must overlap the border per our PlanRibbon spec (absolute -top-2 -right-2).
* Card eyebrow chip:
  text: “Live Dispatch Board”
  style: small pill `inline-block text-[11px] font-semibold text-slate-700 bg-slate-100 border border-slate-200 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] mb-3`
* Card headline (text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900):
  “See every job and every tech in one live board.”
* Card body text (text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed):
  “Drag-and-drop jobs to techs. Color-coded job status. Capacity planning so nobody’s overloaded. You’re never guessing who’s free.”
* Feature bullets (vertical stack, gap-2, each row is flex items-start gap-2):

  * Icon (ClipboardList or LayoutDashboard) `text-[#0B5FFF] w-5 h-5`
  * Text (text-sm text-slate-700 font-medium first line; optional supporting second line text-slate-500 text-[13px]):

    1. “Drag-and-drop scheduling”
       “Assign or reassign work in seconds.”
    2. “Dispatch board for technicians”
       “See who’s on what job, what’s next, and who’s available.”
    3. “Color-coded job status”
       “Everyone understands the board without asking you.”
* CTA block at bottom of card:

  * Primary button (blue): “See Dispatch Flow”
  * Secondary text link under it (blue text-sm font-medium hover:underline): “Start Free →”

Right column: 3 Key Outcomes (not cards, just stacked proof)
Each “outcome row” is:

* Small icon in blue #0B5FFF
* Bold outcome title
* One-line explanation in slate-600

We want three:

Outcome 1:
Title: “Stop the radio calls.”
Copy: “Everyone already knows where they’re going. No more ‘Where do you want me next?’ calls.”

Outcome 2:
Title: “Balance the whole day.”
Copy: “You can see who’s slammed and who’s idle, then drag jobs to rebalance.”

Outcome 3:
Title: “Faster response time.”
Copy: “When an urgent job comes in, drop it on the closest tech from the live map.”

Below these 3 outcomes, include a mini-CTA text link in blue:
“View all scheduling tools →”
This should route to `/features/scheduling-dispatch` (self), or `/features/work-orders-mobile` if you’re cross-linking. You can link to `/features/work-orders-mobile` with label “See what techs see in the field →”.

SECTION 3. Route Optimization & GPS
Background: `bg-slate-50 text-slate-900`

Container utility:
`max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 sm:py-16 grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-10`

Left column:
Headline (text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900):
“Stop burning 45 minutes between every job.”

Subhead (text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-6):
“Auto-build efficient routes, keep drive time tight, and prove where your crews actually were.”

Then a short bulleted list (vertical stack, gap-4):
Each bullet = icon in blue #0B5FFF w-5 h-5 + text block.

* “Route optimization & capacity planning”
  “Stop cramming one tech while two others drive around half-empty.”
* “Dispatch via live map”
  “Drop urgent work on the closest tech. Send them with one tap.”
* “Real-time GPS tracking”
  “Know where the truck actually is. Deliver accurate ETAs without calling.”

Add below bullets a trust line (text-[12px] text-slate-500 leading-snug):
“Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees. You’re not playing license police.”

CTA block under that list:

* Primary button (blue): “See Routing Tools”
* Under-button text link (blue): “Start Free →”

Right column:
A “Route Preview” spotlight card with PlanRibbon.

* Card style same pattern as before (`relative bg-white ring-1 ring-slate-200 rounded-xl shadow-sm ... p-5`)
* `<PlanRibbon plan="Essential+" />` top-right absolute.
* Card eyebrow chip:
  “Route Optimization & GPS”
* Card headline:
  “Shorter drive time. Happier customers.”
* Card body in text-slate-600 text-sm:
  “Build efficient daily routes automatically and get a live view of who’s where. Promise real ETAs and actually hit them.”
* You can render a simple gray map placeholder (div with `bg-slate-100 rounded-lg h-32 w-full mt-4`) labeled “Live Map / Nearest Tech”.

SECTION 4. Calendar Sync (light) + Final CTA band (dark navy)
This section is split: top half is calendar sync messaging on white, bottom half is dark navy call to action.

4A. Calendar Sync
Background: white.

Container:
`max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 sm:py-16`

Headline (text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900):
“Your techs already live in their phone’s calendar. Now you do too.”

Subtext (text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed max-w-2xl):
“Jobs sync to Google Calendar and Apple Calendar automatically. Techs see where to go and when. You stop getting ‘text me the address.’”

Mini bullet row as inline chips:

* Chip style: `inline-block bg-slate-100 text-slate-700 text-[11px] font-medium rounded-full border border-slate-200 px-2 py-[3px] mr-2 mb-2`

  * “Drag-and-drop scheduling (Free)”
  * “Calendar sync (Free)”
  * “Dispatch board (Starter+)”
  * “Route optimization & GPS (Essential+)”

CTA row:

* Primary button (blue): “Start Free”
* Secondary text link in blue small font: “Compare Plans →”

4B. Final CTA Band
Background: dark navy `bg-[#0E2A47] text-white`.

Container:
`max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-12 sm:py-16 text-center`

Headline (text-white font-semibold text-2xl sm:text-3xl):
“Get control of your day in under 10 minutes.”

Subtext (text-white/70 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mt-3):
“Start free. No credit card required. Works with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”

Inline CTA form or stacked buttons (mobile-first):

* Primary CTA button (blue #0B5FFF): “Start Free”
* Secondary outline button (border border-white/30 text-white hover:bg-white/10): “View Pricing”
  Underneath in tiny `text-[11px] text-white/60 mt-2`:
  “By starting, you agree to receive service updates and onboarding guidance. Standard rates apply for SMS usage.”

This is your final conversion hit.

## B. REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

Give this to Replit verbatim:

1. Create a new page component for `/features/scheduling-dispatch` in our Next.js/React structure. Use the same conventions we’re already using for feature pages, including shared layout wrappers, typography classes, and PlanRibbon. Do NOT rebuild the global header/nav/footer.

2. Page-level requirements:

   * Set `<Head>` tags:

     * `<title>Scheduling & Dispatch Software | Drag-and-Drop, Route Optimization, GPS Tracking</title>`
     * `<meta name="description" content="Assign jobs in seconds, balance routes, sync to Google and Apple Calendar, and see every tech live on the map. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees." />`
   * Add JSON-LD structured data of type `SoftwareApplication` with:

     * name: "LinkServicePro Scheduling & Dispatch"
     * applicationCategory: "Field service management software"
     * offers.description: "Start free. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."
       (Match what we already do for structured data.)

3. Build four main sections in this exact order and style:
   SECTION 1 HERO (dark navy #0E2A47),
   SECTION 2 COMMAND BOARD (white),
   SECTION 3 ROUTE OPTIMIZATION & GPS (bg-slate-50),
   SECTION 4 CALENDAR SYNC + FINAL CTA (white + dark navy band back-to-back).

   Follow layout, text, and CTA copy exactly from Section A above. Do not rephrase.

4. Accessibility:

   * All CTA buttons must have `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none`.
   * All text links that look like CTAs must have `hover:underline` and similar focus-visible ring where appropriate.
   * Icons must include `aria-hidden="true"` so they do not become noise for screen readers.
   * Headings must be semantic: H1 only in Section 1. Subsequent section headings are `<h2>`.

5. Spotlight cards:

   * Use `relative bg-white ring-1 ring-slate-200 rounded-xl shadow-sm p-5 hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition duration-150 ease-out motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:transform-none motion-reduce:hover:shadow-sm`.
   * Immediately inside a spotlight card, render `<PlanRibbon plan="Starter+" />` or `"Essential+"` based on the plan callout for that card. Position with `absolute -top-2 -right-2 z-20`.
   * Add the eyebrow chip (tiny pill) above the headline inside each spotlight card.
   * Include bulleted feature points with lucide icons in `text-[#0B5FFF] w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0` and bullet text in `text-sm text-slate-700` (or `text-slate-600` for body lines).
   * Ribbon and chips must look like they belong to our Pro-Blueprint system.

6. Outcome rows (the right column in Section 2) are just simple flex rows, not cards:

   * Icon in blue #0B5FFF.
   * Title bold `text-slate-900`.
   * One-line copy in `text-slate-600 text-sm`.

7. The “Route Optimization & GPS” section:

   * Left column is descriptive text and CTA.
   * Right column is a spotlight card with PlanRibbon "Essential+".
   * Inside that card, include a `div` placeholder for a map preview: `bg-slate-100 rounded-lg h-32 w-full mt-4 flex items-center justify-center text-[11px] text-slate-500`. Text inside: “Live Map / Nearest Tech”.

8. The Calendar Sync + Final CTA section is actually two consecutive blocks:
   4A. Calendar Sync block (white bg).
   4B. Final CTA band (dark navy #0E2A47).

   * Calendar Sync block must include the four inline chips:
     “Drag-and-drop scheduling (Free)”, “Calendar sync (Free)”, “Dispatch board (Starter+)”, “Route optimization & GPS (Essential+)”
     Chips styling: `inline-block bg-slate-100 text-slate-700 text-[11px] font-medium rounded-full border border-slate-200 px-2 py-[3px] mr-2 mb-2`.
   * Final CTA band must be full-width `bg-[#0E2A47] text-white`, centered text, plus the two-button CTA (“Start Free” primary blue button  #0B5FFF  and “View Pricing” outline button).
   * Under these buttons, include TCPA-style tiny line in `text-[11px] text-white/60`.

9. Absolutely include the “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.” line in Section 1 hero AND again in Section 3 trust line under the bullet list (“Unlimited users on paid plans…”). This message must repeat on this page.

10. Internal linking:

* In Section 2 (Command Board), at the bottom of the right column after the 3 “Outcome” rows, include a text link:
  “See what techs see in the field →”
  Link to `/features/work-orders-mobile`.
  Style this link `text-[#0B5FFF] text-sm font-medium hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 rounded`.

11. Do not show mock screenshots with real data. Use simple gray / slate placeholders as described. Label them clearly (e.g. “Today’s Dispatch Board”, “Live Map / Nearest Tech”) so later we can drop in screenshots.

12. Do not remove global header/nav/footer.

13. After implementing, ensure mobile:

* All sections stack vertically.
* The two-column grids become single column via `grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2`.
* CTA buttons stack vertical on small screens with `flex flex-col gap-3`.

14. After building `/features/scheduling-dispatch`, expose it in any “See Dispatch Flow” or “Scheduling & Dispatch” internal links across the site.

If the agent follows the spec exactly, we get a production-quality, conversion-grade Scheduling & Dispatch feature page with correct brand, CTA density, SEO language, internal linking, and accessibility.

This page is now ready to ship and crawl.
