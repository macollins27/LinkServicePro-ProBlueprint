Replace HomeResults30 with a compact, balanced 3-card row.

Section: HomeResults30
File: src/sections/HomeResults30.tsx
Mount: directly under home hero

OBJECTIVE
- Kill blank space. Each card same visual height.
- Remove “Minutes saved per job” input. Assume 10 minutes saved per job behind the scenes.
- Make estimator a slim strip (2 inputs + results), not a tall form.
- Densify left/right cards with 2×2 grids of concise items.
- Keep standardized CTAs below row.

LAYOUT
- Wrapper: <section className="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6">
- Image stays above row (full width). Cards row below: class="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-3 items-stretch"
- Card shell: class="rounded-none ring-1 ring-slate-200 shadow elev-2 p-4 sm:p-5 grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto] h-full"
- Reduce vertical padding and internal gaps: use space-y-3.

COPY (verbatim)

H2: “Results you can feel in 30 days.”
Sub: “Save time, win more jobs, and get paid sooner — without changing how your team works in the field.”

LEFT CARD — title: “Quick wins”
2×2 grid (no bullets; perfect alignment):
- “Save 6–10 hours per week” — “Drag-and-drop scheduling with automated reminders.”
- “Increase quote win rate by 22%” — “E-sign quotes that convert into work orders.”
- “Cut time to payment by 3 days” — “Deposits, partials, and batch invoicing with accounting sync.”
- “Same-day invoices” — “Finish the job and send the bill before you leave.”

MIDDLE CARD — title: “Savings estimator”
Inputs (two only, inline):
- Label: “Technicians”   <input type="number" min=1 max=200 defaultValue=3>
- Label: “Jobs per tech per week”   <input type="number" min=1 max=100 defaultValue=20>
Assumption: fixed behind the scenes at 10 minutes per job. Do NOT render a control.
Helper (single line, small): “We assume 10 minutes saved per job on average. Adjust technicians or jobs.”
Results (inline, bold, no tall blocks):
- “Hours saved per month: {X}”
- “Estimated monthly savings: ${Y}”
Fine print (tiny): “Uses a blended labor rate of $35 per hour.” Add a small number input to change rate ONLY if space allows; else omit and keep $35 hardcoded.

RIGHT CARD — title: “Proven in the field”
Top quote (2 lines max):
“Scheduling takes under five minutes and invoices go out the same day. Customers love the portal.”
Byline: “— Maya Lopez, Owner, BrightPath Cleaning”
Dense 2×2 proof grid (fills space cleanly):
- “★★★★★ 5.0/5 App Store”
- “★★★★★ 5.0/5 Google”
- “SOC 2 Security”
- “QuickBooks / Xero”
Trust row (small chips under grid):
- “No long-term contract”
- “iOS & Android”

CTA ROW (below cards; center)
import { StartFreeButton, ViewPricingButton, ButtonsRow } from "@/components/Buttons";
<ButtonsRow className="mt-4">
  <StartFreeButton context="light" />
  <ViewPricingButton context="light" />
</ButtonsRow>

ESTIMATOR LOGIC (fixed assumption = 10 min/job)
State:
  technicians: number
  jobsPerTechPerWeek: number
  laborRate: number = 35 // can be hidden or small input
Derive:
  const minutesPerJob = 10; // fixed
  const weeklyMinutes = technicians * jobsPerTechPerWeek * minutesPerJob
  const monthlyHours = Math.round((weeklyMinutes * 4.33) / 60)
  const monthlySavings = Math.round(monthlyHours * laborRate)
Render compact inline:
  <p><strong>Hours saved per month:</strong> {monthlyHours} hours</p>
  <p><strong>Estimated monthly savings:</strong> ${monthlySavings.toLocaleString()} per month</p>
a11y: status <div id="estimator-status" aria-live="polite"> updates on input change.

DENSITY / WHITESPACE CONTROLS
- Left/right internal grids: class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-3"
  Each item: title (font-semibold text-slate-900) + desc (text-slate-700). No extra margins.
- Right proof grid: class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2"
- Remove tall sliders or stacked form groups.
- Card footers empty; row 3 of grid stays minimal to keep heights equal without dead space.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Section role="region" aria-labelledby="home-results-h2"
- Labels bound to inputs; aria-invalid on bounds errors.
- Focus rings: add class "focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-white" to inputs.
- Quote marked up with <blockquote> and <cite>.

- No abbreviations in UI.
- Estimator understandable in 3 seconds; only two inputs.
- Ratings show 5.0/5; chips wrap neatly without overflow at 375px.
