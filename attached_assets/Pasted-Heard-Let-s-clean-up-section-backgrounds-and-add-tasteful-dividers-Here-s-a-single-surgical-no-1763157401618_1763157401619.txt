Heard. Let’s clean up section backgrounds and add tasteful dividers. Here’s a **single, surgical, no-code prompt** for Replit Agent 3 to **standardize homepage backgrounds**, **alternate white / blue-with-grid themes**, and **insert a 60–80px collage divider** (Jobber-style) between select bands—mobile-first, accessible, and fast.

---

## Task

Refactor the **homepage section backgrounds and dividers** to create clear visual rhythm:

* Introduce **two background themes** (White, Blue w/ grid overlay).
* Add an optional **collage divider strip** (60–80px tall) between chosen sections.
* Do **not** change section content/copy; only wrappers, backgrounds, and dividers.
* Keep everything inside the global container width and existing design tokens.

---

## Scope & guardrails

* Touch only the homepage section wrappers and theme utilities; no route/SEO changes.
* Reuse tokens (colors, spacing, border radii, z-index, container).
* Respect dark-mode if present (map White→light surface, Blue→dark surface).
* No tooltips/portals. No third-party libraries.

---

## 1) Add background theme utilities

Create a tiny, reusable system (utilities or component variants):

**Themes**

* `bg-theme--white`

  * Background: site light surface (pure white or `--surface-1`).
  * Text color: default body text.
* `bg-theme--navy`

  * Background: site navy (current homepage blue).
  * Text color: light on dark tokens.

**Grid overlay variant**

* `bg-grid`

  * Adds a **subtle grid** on top of the background using CSS gradients (no images).
  * Grid spec (adjustable by token):

    * Line every **48px**, 1px line at `--grid-color` (low contrast).
    * Use dual linear-gradient trick; ensure **no CLS**.
  * Reduce grid opacity for readability; disable for `prefers-reduced-transparency`.

**Implementation notes**

* Use CSS custom properties:

  * `--section-bg`
  * `--grid-color` (e.g., `rgb(255 255 255 / 0.06)` on navy, `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.04)` on white)
* Apply grid via `background-image: linear-gradient(...)`, **not** background SVGs, to avoid extra requests.

## 2) Collage divider component

Create `SectionDividerCollage` used **between** sections (not inside them).

**Behavior**

* Height: **60–80px** (mobile 60px, desktop 80px).
* Full-bleed width (edge-to-edge), but **respects safe-area insets**.
* Sits in its own `<div role="presentation" aria-hidden="true">`.
* Default is **image collage**; if images fail, fall back to **torn-paper SVG**.

**Visual**

* Row of tightly packed thumbnails (4–8 images), object-cover, subtle 2px gap or no gap (choose whichever looks better with our brand).
* Slight overlay (`linear-gradient` fade at edges) so it melts into both sections.
* Optional **micro parallax** on desktop only (translateY 4–6px on scroll); disable for `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Content source**

* Use **generated stock** (AI image generation) sized **1600×120** (or 2× for retina).
* Prompts (generate 10–12; rotate 6–8):

  * “HVAC tech servicing rooftop unit, candid, widescreen crop, toolbelt, daylight”
  * “Electrician inspecting breaker panel, gloves, crisp focus”
  * “Plumber tightening copper pipe, torch in frame, workshop feel”
  * “Crew riding mowers, lawn stripes, sunrise”
  * “Window cleaning on lift, urban glass reflections”
  * “Janitorial floor scrubber, commercial hallway, motion”
* Save as optimized WebP/AVIF; name by theme (e.g., `/assets/collage/field-collage-01.webp`).

**Fallback**

* If no images, render a **subtle torn-paper edge** (SVG path) matching brand colors.
* Provide both **light** and **dark** variants.

## 3) Standardize section wrappers (order + assignment)

Apply themes and dividers as follows (mobile → desktop identical in structure):

1. **Hero** → `bg-theme--navy bg-grid`

   * Divider **on** after hero: `SectionDividerCollage(light→dark blend)`.
2. **Industries** → `bg-theme--white`

   * No divider after if next band is light→light; if so, insert torn-paper divider.
3. **“Why Teams Switch” (cards version)** → `bg-theme--navy bg-grid`

   * Divider **on** after (collage).
4. **Property Linkware Integration** → `bg-theme--white`

   * Optional divider after if next band is white; otherwise none.
5. **Primary CTA (email field + button)** → `bg-theme--navy`

   * No grid to keep focus on form. Divider **on** after (collage).
6. **Pricing teaser** → `bg-theme--white`
7. **Resources gateway** → `bg-theme--white` (if adjacent to white, add torn-paper divider).
8. **FAQ** → `bg-theme--navy bg-grid`

   * Divider **off** before footer (footer already dark).

> If your actual homepage order differs, keep the **alternating principle**: White ↔ Navy(Grid), and insert collage only when you want an energetic beat between major bands.

## 4) Spacing, borders, and contrast

* Unify vertical rhythm: same top/bottom padding tokens used site-wide.
* Optional **1px hairline** separators on light themes (`border-t border-black/5`).
* Ensure text contrast meets **WCAG AA** on both themes.
* Keep grid lines subtle; never overpower text/CTAs.

---

## 5) Performance

* Collage images: pre-generate and **lazy-load**; set explicit width/height to prevent CLS.
* Serve AVIF/WebP with JPEG fallback when needed.
* No external scripts; pure CSS for grids and torn edges.
* Use `loading="lazy" decoding="async"` on images; `fetchpriority="low"`.

---

## 6) Accessibility

* Dividers are **decorative**: `role="presentation" aria-hidden="true"`.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (disable parallax).
* Section landmarks remain intact (no nesting aside from decorative dividers).

---

## 7) Acceptance checklist

1. Homepage shows **alternating section themes**: white vs. navy(grid) with consistent padding and container width.
2. **Collage divider** appears where specified, is exactly **60–80px** tall, and does **not** create CLS.
3. Dark/light tokens keep all text and CTAs readable; grid lines are subtle.
4. No tooltips/portals/scripts added; Lighthouse has **no CLS** regressions.
5. Divider is decorative (not keyboard focusable); motion respects user settings.

---

## 8) Implementation notes (how to wire quickly)

* Add utility classes (or component variants) for themes and `bg-grid`.
* Create `SectionDividerCollage(images?: string[], variant?: "torn" | "collage")`.
* Insert divider components **between** sections per mapping above.
* Generate and commit 10–12 collage images (AVIF/WebP).
* Test across breakpoints and dark/light mode.

Ship this refactor, then we can A/B where the collage appears (e.g., only after key conversion bands) to balance personality with performance.
