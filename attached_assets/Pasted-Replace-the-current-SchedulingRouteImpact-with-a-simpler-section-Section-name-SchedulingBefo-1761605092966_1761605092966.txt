Replace the current “SchedulingRouteImpact” with a simpler section.

Section name: “SchedulingBeforeAfter”
File: src/sections/SchedulingBeforeAfter.tsx
Insert: import and render after SchedulingPainSolve in src/routes/features/scheduling.tsx

GOAL
Show exactly what changes when a job is dragged. Before vs After, side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile. Convert with standardized buttons.

STACK
React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui (Radix), Wouter, TanStack Query.
Theme: Pro-Blueprint. WCAG AA+. Mobile-first.

COPY (use verbatim)
- H2: “See the schedule settle instantly.”
- Sub: “Drag a job. Conflicts clear, ETAs update, and customers get the new window.”
- Scenario selector (as small tabs):
  1) “Reassign job to Tech 2”
  2) “Pull 3 PM to 11:30 AM”
  3) “Rain delay: move exterior jobs”
- Delta badges (right column After panel):
  * “Conflict cleared”
  * “Drive time −12 min”
  * “On-time window +8%”
  * “Customer text sent”

LAYOUT
- Mobile 375–639: stack panels (Before on top, After below). Sticky CTA under panels.
- ≥640: grid with two equal columns: Before | After. Right side shows delta badges and change log.
- Card shells: white, ring-1 slate-200, elev-2, sharp corners.

INTERACTION
- No external DnD libs. Simulate drag with a “Play change” button.
- BEFORE panel: three tech lanes (T1, T2, T3) as simple vertical lists with timestamps and job cards.
  * One job shows a red “Overlap: 2:15–2:45” badge.
- AFTER panel: same lanes with the job moved. Show green badges:
  * “Rescheduled to 11:30 AM”
  * “Route time −12 min”
  * “Customer text sent”
- When user changes scenario tab:
  * Update the job positions in both panels and rotate the green badges accordingly.
  * Write to aria-live region: “Scenario applied: <tab label>. Conflict cleared. Drive time −12 min.”
- Provide a compact “What changed” list (max 3 items) under the After panel:
  * “Moved Leak Repair to Tech 2”
  * “ETA text sent to customer”
  * “Route resequenced A→B→C”

CTA
- Use standardized buttons from src/components/Buttons.tsx:
  import { StartFreeButton, ViewPricingButton, ButtonsRow } from "@/components/Buttons";
- Place inside ButtonsRow below the panels (mobile stacked, ≥640 row).
- Use `context="light"`.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Tabs use role="tablist"/role="tab" with roving tabindex.
- Panels labelled:
  * BEFORE: role="region" aria-label="Before schedule"
  * AFTER: role="region" aria-label="After schedule"
- aria-live="polite" region id="ba-status" for scenario updates.
- All interactive elements have visible #0B5FFF focus ring with proper ring-offset (white for light).

CODE REQUIREMENTS
- Export default function SchedulingBeforeAfter(): JSX.Element
- State: activeScenario: 0|1|2; beforeJobs[], afterJobs[] derived from scenario
- Components:
  * ScenarioTabs
  * SchedulePanel({ title: "Before" | "After", jobsByTech })
  * DeltaBadges (uses exact copy above)
  * ChangeLog
  * CTA block with ButtonsRow + StartFreeButton + ViewPricingButton
- data-testid hooks:
  * data-testid="scenario-tabs"
  * data-testid="before-panel"
  * data-testid="after-panel"
  * data-testid="delta-badges"
  * data-testid="cta-start-free"

STYLES
- Tech lane headers: “T1”, “T2”, “T3” in small sharp labels.
- Job cards: square, bordered, timestamp + title. Red badge for overlaps in Before; green badges in After.
- Hover underline animation on links right→left per theme.
- Optional subtle blueprint grid background on panel containers via `bg-blueprint`.

CONTENT (seed the lanes exactly)
Initial BEFORE:
- T1: 9:00 Filter change, 10:30 Thermostat, 2:30 Leak repair [Overlap: 2:15–2:45]
- T2: 11:45 Open, 12:30 Maintenance
- T3: 3:30 Tune-up

Scenario effects:
1) Reassign job to Tech 2 → AFTER: move “Leak repair” to T2 at 11:30; show green badges Drive time −12 min, On-time window +8%, Customer text sent.
2) Pull 3 PM to 11:30 AM → AFTER: move T3 “Tune-up” to 11:30; badges Conflict cleared, On-time window +8%, Customer text sent.
3) Rain delay: move exterior jobs → AFTER: mark exterior tasks moved to tomorrow; badges Conflict cleared, Customer text sent.

QA GATES
- No overflow at 375px.
- Lighthouse: ≥90 Performance, ≥95 Accessibility on this route.
- Tabs operable by keyboard; Enter/Space activate.
- aria-live updates on scenario change.
- Buttons meet standardized specs and pass focus-ring checks.

IMAGE PROMPT (optional hero for this section)
“Field technician indoors by an air handler, using a smartphone to reschedule a ‘Leak repair’ from 2:30 to 11:30; natural light; candid documentary; shallow depth of field; navy/blue accents; no paper, no visible brand logos; medium close-up.”
