## Task

Redesign the **Drag-and-drop Scheduling** feature page as a high-converting landing page for searches like “HVAC company scheduling software.” Mobile-first, sharp corners, high contrast, no horizontal scroll at 375px. Every section starts with **Title + Subtitle** top-left. Use rectangular buttons with bold labels. Add sticky bottom CTA and an inline lead form. Tone: practical for contractors.

In addition, **AI-generate all page imagery** to create a “that’s me at work” reaction. Use the **Image Generation Specs** and **Asset Manifest** below. Place each image exactly where specified.

## Copy to render (use verbatim)

### 1) Hero band

* **Title:** Drag-and-drop Scheduling
* **Subtitle:** Schedule faster and keep crews in sync.
* **KPIs:**
  `−18%` — Drive time
  `+1.3` — Jobs per tech per day
  `96%` — On-time arrival
* **CTAs:** Start Free (primary), View Pricing (secondary)

### 2) What it does

* Drag jobs on a live calendar → crews and customers auto-notified.
* Assign crews and vehicles → no double-booking.
* See day, week, and route capacity → prevent overtime.

### 3) Why teams switch (Pain → Solve)

* **Pain:** Spreadsheets break when multiple people edit. Office can’t see who’s free across all crews. Techs get double-booked or sent to wrong locations. Overtime surprises on Fridays.
* **Solve:** Real-time calendar with conflict warnings. Color-coded availability by crew and vehicle. Drag once → everyone gets notified (SMS/email). Capacity view with hour caps and overtime alerts.

### 4) How it works (3 steps)

* **Step 1:** Create job — add photos, line items, and service window.
* **Step 2:** Place on calendar — drag to day; assign crew and truck.
* **Step 3:** Notify — customers and techs get the updated time automatically.

### 5) In the field (testimonial)

* “We reshuffle routes in minutes and cut callbacks.” — Mike R., Owner, HVAC

### 6) Works with (integrations chips)

* QuickBooks, Xero, LinkInspectPro, PropertyLinkWare, SMS/Email

### 7) Mini demo + lead capture

* **Left:** “See it in 60 seconds” mock (16:9) with captions: Live calendar with conflict flags; Drag to assign crew and vehicle; Auto text to customer.
* **Right:** Lead form (email + company) titled “See it with your jobs.” Button: Book a demo. Success: “Thanks — we’ll reach out within one business day.”

### 8) Related features

* Dispatch Board + Live Map — See every crew on screen.
* Route Optimization — Shortest routes, more jobs per tech.
* Capacity Planning — Balance workload and prevent overtime.

### 9) FAQ (accordion, max 6)

* How long does setup take? Most teams import in under a day.
* Can I reschedule from my phone? Yes. iOS and Android supported.
* Will crews get alerts? Yes. Techs and customers receive SMS/email.
* What if I double-book? You’ll see a conflict flag before saving.
* Does it handle recurring jobs? Yes. Daily, weekly, monthly patterns.
* Does it work offline? The mobile app queues updates and syncs later.

### 10) Bottom CTA band

* **Headline:** Ready to try it?
* **Subcopy:** Simple pricing. No contracts.
* **Buttons:** View Pricing, Start Free

### 11) Sticky bottom CTA

* **Text:** Ready to try it?
