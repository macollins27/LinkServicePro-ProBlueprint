## Objective

Finish the homepage as a mobile-first, conversion-optimized site with a consistent “wow” aesthetic. Keep sharp corners, high contrast, one primary action per section, and reduced-motion safety.

## Non-negotiables

* **Do not modify** the **Projects & Job Costing** section. Leave code and layout exactly as is.
* **Every section** on the page must start with a **Title + Subtitle** block at the **top-left** (same hierarchy and spacing as “From Quote to Payment / Turn estimates into work orders and get paid faster.”).
* Keep prior redesign patterns you already implemented for the hero, Immediate Value, Feature Clusters, Scheduling & Dispatch, From Quote to Payment, Keep Customers in the Loop, Built for Your Trade.
* No carousels. No horizontal scrolling on mobile.
* No new libraries.

## Global System

* Mobile first at 375px. No horizontal scroll anywhere.
* Typography: Body 16px mobile / 18px desktop. H2 24/32. Max line length 28–36 chars mobile, 48–64 desktop.
* Color discipline: primary blue for CTAs/links/active; teal for ops; green for profit; amber for alerts; neutrals for everything else.
* Spacing rhythm: 16px unit. Section vertical padding 24–32 mobile, 48 desktop.
* Buttons: rectangle, sharp, bold type; link hover underline animates right→left.
* Accessibility: semantic headings, tab order, focus-visible rings, proper `tablist/tab/tabpanel` where used, `prefers-reduced-motion` honored.
