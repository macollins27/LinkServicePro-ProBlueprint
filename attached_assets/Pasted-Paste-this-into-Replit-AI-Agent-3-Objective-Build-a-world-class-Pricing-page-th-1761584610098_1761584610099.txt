## Page structure (exact order)

1. **Hero band**

   * Title: **Simple, transparent pricing**
   * Subtitle: *Pick your plan. Switch anytime. No contracts.*
   * Toggle: **Monthly / Annual (save 16%)**. On toggle, prices and “per user” footers update with smooth 120ms transition.
   * Trust row: lock icon “Secure checkout”, “Cancel anytime”, “No setup fees”.
   * CTA buttons: **Start Free** (primary), **Talk to sales** (secondary).

2. **Plan cards (5)**

   * Mobile: horizontal scroll **snap**; ≥768px: 3-up; ≥1200px: 5-up.
   * Each card: plan name, price (monthly + crossed-out annual equivalent when Annual is on), brief fit statement, top 6 highlights, primary CTA, secondary “See all features”.
   * Add “Most popular” ribbon to **Professional**. Add “Best value” badge on **Business** when Annual is on.
   * Buttons are rectangular, bold, full-width on mobile.
   * Include usage caps and users per plan where applicable (see “Plan facts” below).

3. **Feature comparison matrix**

   * Sticky sub-nav: *Scheduling & Dispatch • Mobile App • CRM • Work Orders • Estimates & Invoicing • GPS & Time • Reporting • Integrations & Automation • Support & Security*
   * Mobile: accordions per category showing rows with ✓ / — / “Upgrade” pill. Desktop: full matrix with frozen first column + plan headers.
   * Row copy & plan availability must follow the tier specs below (“Plan facts”) and source docs.  

4. **Calculator (optional but recommended)**

   * Inputs: Technicians (#), Office users (#). Output: **Estimated monthly total** per plan (price + per-tech GPS add-on if enabled) with a bar chart. Let users email the estimate to themselves (inline lead capture).

5. **What’s included in every plan**

   * 6 icon chips: Scheduling, Mobile app, CRM contacts, Estimates & invoices, Templates, Categories. Short “action → outcome” copy.

6. **Questions? (FAQ)**

   * 6 items, short and direct: *How billing works? Can I add users mid-month? What’s counted as a user? Can I change plans? What discounts exist? Do you offer trials?*
   * Include `FAQPage` JSON-LD.

7. **Proof & trust**

   * 3 micro-testimonials (HVAC, Landscaping, Cleaning) with one-line results.
   * Security badges, uptime link, and support availability per plan.

8. **Final CTA band**

   * Headline: **Ready to get started?**

## Visual & interaction rules

* Mobile-first at 375px. No horizontal scroll. Tap targets ≥44px.
* Plan cards: white background, 1px slate-200 ring, `.elev-2` shadow; on hover: lift + shadow increase.
* Pricing numbers use large numeric with smaller “/mo” and “per user” footers when applicable.
* Accessibility: visible focus rings, proper `aria-expanded` on accordions, `aria-pressed` on billing toggle.
* Performance: preload plan font, lazy-load non-hero images, CLS < 0.05, Lighthouse ≥90/≥95 (Perf/A11y).
