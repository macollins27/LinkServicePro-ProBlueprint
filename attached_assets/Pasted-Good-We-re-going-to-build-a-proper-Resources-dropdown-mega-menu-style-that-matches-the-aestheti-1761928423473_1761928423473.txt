Good. We’re going to build a proper “Resources” dropdown (mega menu style) that matches the aesthetic of your existing mega menus for Features and Industries — clean navy accents, subtle borders, cards with icons, right-hand promo block, mobile-friendly first.

We’ll do 2 parts:

1. What it should look like / behave like
2. The exact Replit prompt to implement it (add to header nav under “Resources”)

You can hand Replit the prompt directly. It will not require a rebuild — just add one more dropdown config component.

–––
PART 1. DESIGN / BEHAVIOR

### Trigger

* Top nav item: “Resources”
* On hover (desktop) or tap (mobile), opens a wide dropdown panel.
* Panel is roughly the same width / shadow style / rounded-xl / border as the other mega menus you had me tune.
* It should not feel like a sad little list. It needs to feel like: “We train serious operators.”

### Layout inside the dropdown

We’re going with a **3-column layout** on desktop, stacked on mobile:

**Column 1: Learn the business**
This column links to the high-authority / evergreen stuff (blog + guides).
These are the things that position you as “the one who teaches the trades how to win.”

**Column 2: Get help**
This column links to Help Center and other support content (Help, Category pages, Contact support).
This is: “You’re not alone” energy.

**Column 3 (Right-side promo tile): Get started**
Mini callout card in a darker/navy background or light-slate background that pitches the product and drives to signup / talk to sales.

This matches what we did in Features and Industries: left/middle = navigation; right = trust + CTA.

### Column 1 content (Learn the business)

Heading:

* Small label text-[11px] uppercase font-semibold text-slate-500 tracking-wide
  “LEARN THE BUSINESS”

Items (each is a row with icon, title, 1-line subtext):

1. Blog & Updates
   Icon: Newspaper
   Title: “Blog & Updates”
   Subtext: “Field-tested tactics, product updates, honest advice.”
   Link: `/blog`

2. Free Guides & Playbooks
   Icon: BookOpen
   Title: “Free Guides & Playbooks”
   Subtext: “Dispatch, pricing, recurring revenue, same-day payment.”
   Link: `/guides`

3. Webinars & Training
   Icon: Video
   Title: “Webinars & Training”
   Subtext: “Live / on-demand sessions for owners and ops.”
   Link: `/webinars` (route stub is fine for now)

Visual style for each row:

* `flex gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-slate-50 hover:shadow-sm hover:ring-1 hover:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 outline-none`
* Icon wrapper:
  `flex h-9 w-9 items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-[#0B5FFF]/10 text-[#0B5FFF] ring-1 ring-[#0B5FFF]/20`
* Title: `text-[14px] font-semibold text-slate-900 leading-tight`
* Subtext: `text-[12px] text-slate-600 leading-snug`

Spacing:

* Stack these in a column with `gap-1`.

### Column 2 content (Get help)

Heading:

* “GET HELP” (same heading style as above, small gray uppercase)

Items:

1. Help Center
   Icon: LifeBuoy
   Title: “Help Center”
   Subtext: “Step-by-step answers for scheduling, dispatch, invoices, and more.”
   Link: `/help`

2. Popular Articles
   Icon: ClipboardList
   Title: “Popular Articles”
   Subtext: “How to schedule jobs, take deposits, and send e-sign estimates.”
   Link: `/help` (anchor to Popular section or just `/help`)

3. Contact Support
   Icon: Headset / Phone / Mail (lucide Phone or Mail or Headphones)
   Title: “Contact Support”
   Subtext: “Email or call 631-206-3700 Mon–Fri 9a–5p ET.”
   Link: `mailto:info@bimscorp.com` or `/help` if you’d rather drive them there first.
   We’ll point it to `/help` for now because that page already shows phone + email.

Same row styling pattern as Column 1.

### Column 3 content (Right promo tile)

This is the credibility / CTA block. It should visually stand out.

Card style:

* Rounded-xl
* Navy background `#0E2A47`
* White text
* Ring-1 ring-slate-800
* Shadow-inner subtle

Content:

* Small chip:
  className: `inline-block rounded-full bg-white/10 border border-white/20 text-white/80 text-[11px] font-semibold px-2 py-[2px] mb-2`
  Text: “Built for the field”
* Headline (white):
  “Stop duct-taping 4 apps”
  className: `text-[15px] font-semibold text-white leading-snug`
* Subtext (white/70):
  “Live dispatch board, route planning, quotes with e-sign, and same-day payment — all in one hub.”
  className: `text-[12px] leading-snug text-white/70 mt-1`
* CTA buttons stacked vertically:

  * Primary “Get Started Free” → `/signup`
    className =
    `bg-[#0B5FFF] text-white text-[13px] font-semibold rounded-md px-3 py-2 shadow-sm hover:opacity-90 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-white focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-[#0E2A47] outline-none`
  * Secondary “Talk to Sales” → `/contact`
    className =
    `text-white/80 text-[13px] font-semibold rounded-md px-3 py-2 ring-1 ring-white/30 hover:text-white hover:bg-white/10 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-white focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-[#0E2A47] outline-none`
* Fine print under buttons:
  text-[11px] text-white/60 leading-snug:
  “Works with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar. Unlimited users on paid plans.”

This right-side card lowers fear. It quietly re-sells your product even while they’re exploring “Resources.”

### Mobile behavior

On mobile:

* The dropdown should not try to render 3 columns side-by-side.
* It should stack:

  * Learn the Business (all rows)
  * Get Help (all rows)
  * Then the navy promo tile last
* Full width, no horizontal scrolling.
* All tap targets must be at least 44px tall.

Use `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-[1fr_1fr_auto]` desktop, but on mobile `grid-cols-1`. Column 3 can just drop below as its own row.

### Accessibility

* The whole dropdown panel should appear on focus as well as hover.
* Every row must have proper `focus-visible:ring-2` etc.
* Icons should be `aria-hidden="true"`.
* The `Resources` nav item should have `aria-haspopup="true"` and `aria-expanded={isOpen}`.

Now we turn that into an implementation prompt Replit can execute.

PART 2. REPLIT PROMPT (PASTE THIS)

```txt
You are Replit Agent. Do NOT rebuild the project. Stack: React + Vite + Wouter + Tailwind + react-helmet + lucide-react. We already have top nav with mega menus for Features and Industries. We’re adding a new mega dropdown for "Resources" that matches our site theme.

GOAL
Add a “Resources” mega menu dropdown to the main header nav. The dropdown panel has 3 columns on desktop (Learn / Get Help / CTA card) and stacks vertically on mobile.

REQUIREMENTS
- Use same trigger behavior / animation style / container width / border / shadow / rounded-xl used by our existing mega menus so it visually fits.
- Keep colors consistent: navy #0E2A47 for the right-side CTA tile, CTA blue #0B5FFF for accents.
- All links use <Link> from wouter.
- All interactive elements must have focus-visible ring classes the same way we’ve been doing.
- Mobile-first responsive.

STEP 1: COMPONENT
Create a new component `ResourcesMegaMenu.tsx` in `src/components/nav/ResourcesMegaMenu.tsx`.

This component should expose:
- A trigger button/Link labeled "Resources"
- A panel that opens on hover (desktop) or tap/focus (mobile), similar to how we’re doing it for Features/Industries.
- Accepts close/open state from parent OR self-manages with internal state consistent with how the other mega menus are done. Follow the pattern we already used for FeaturesMegaMenu / IndustriesMegaMenu.

Inside the panel, render:

WRAPPER
<div className="w-full max-w-5xl bg-white rounded-xl shadow-xl ring-1 ring-slate-200 p-4 grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-[1fr_1fr_auto]">
  <!-- Column 1 -->
  <!-- Column 2 -->
  <!-- Column 3 (CTA card) -->
</div>

COLUMN 1: "LEARN THE BUSINESS"
<div className="flex flex-col">
  <div className="text-[11px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-500 mb-2">LEARN THE BUSINESS</div>

  <Link ...> Blog & Updates </Link>
  <Link ...> Free Guides & Playbooks </Link>
  <Link ...> Webinars & Training </Link>
</div>

Each row under this heading is a card-style row:
- Wrapper:
  className="group flex gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-slate-50 hover:shadow-sm hover:ring-1 hover:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 outline-none"
  tabindex="0"
- Left icon box:
  className="flex h-9 w-9 items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-[#0B5FFF]/10 text-[#0B5FFF] ring-1 ring-[#0B5FFF]/20 flex-shrink-0"
  Use lucide-react icons:
    - Newspaper for Blog
    - BookOpen for Guides
    - Video for Webinars
  Give each icon `aria-hidden="true"`.

- Text block:
  <div className="flex flex-col">
    <div className="text-[14px] font-semibold text-slate-900 leading-tight">TITLE HERE</div>
    <div className="text-[12px] text-slate-600 leading-snug">SUBTEXT HERE</div>
  </div>

Links + copy:
1. Blog & Updates
   href="/blog"
   subtext="Field-tested tactics, product updates, honest advice."

2. Free Guides & Playbooks
   href="/guides"
   subtext="Dispatch, pricing, recurring revenue, same-day payment."

3. Webinars & Training
   href="/webinars"
   subtext="Live / on-demand sessions for owners and ops."

COLUMN 2: "GET HELP"
<div className="flex flex-col">
  <div className="text-[11px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-500 mb-2">GET HELP</div>

  Repeat same row pattern (icon box + text block) for each:

  A) Help Center
     href="/help"
     Icon: LifeBuoy
     Title: "Help Center"
     Subtext: "Step-by-step answers for scheduling, dispatch, invoices, and more."

  B) Popular Articles
     href="/help"
     Icon: ClipboardList
     Title: "Popular Articles"
     Subtext: "Scheduling jobs, taking deposits, sending e-sign estimates."

  C) Contact Support
     href="/help"
     Icon: Phone (or Headphones/Mail if that matches our icon set)
     Title: "Contact Support"
     Subtext: "Email or call 631-206-3700 Mon–Fri 9a–5p ET."

Make sure each row has:
className="group flex gap-3 p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-slate-50 hover:shadow-sm hover:ring-1 hover:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 outline-none"
tabIndex={0}
and each <Link> wraps the whole row so it’s a single tap target (minimum ~44px height).

COLUMN 3: CTA CARD
Right column is a promo tile to drive leads.

<div className="flex flex-col justify-between rounded-xl bg-[#0E2A47] text-white ring-1 ring-slate-800 shadow-inner p-4 w-full max-w-[260px]">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

STEP 2: RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
- On mobile / small screens: the panel layout should stack vertically instead of side-by-side.
  - Use `grid gap-6 grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-[1fr_1fr_auto]`.
  - At <lg, let column 3 (CTA card) just drop under columns 1 and 2 so it’s still visible.
- Ensure tap targets are full width on mobile and have at least 44px height.

STEP 3: ACCESSIBILITY
- The “Resources” nav trigger must include aria-haspopup="true" and aria-expanded={true/false} depending on open state, following exactly how our other mega menus handle this.
- Every interactive row inside columns 1 and 2 must be reachable by keyboard tab.
- Icons should include aria-hidden="true".
- Maintain focus-visible ring classes (focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 outline-none). This is the same accessibility style we’re using across the site.

STEP 4: INTEGRATE INTO NAV
- Import this new `ResourcesMegaMenu` component into whatever header/nav component currently renders FeaturesMegaMenu and IndustriesMegaMenu.
- Place it in the same horizontal nav row, labeled "Resources".
- Ensure the Resources tab both:
  - opens this dropdown,
  - and direct-click of the word “Resources” (or a “View all resources →” row at the bottom of Column 1) links to `/resources`.

We already have `/resources`, `/blog`, `/guides`, `/help`, etc. So all links must match those exact routes. Do not rename routes.

STEP 5: NO REGRESSIONS
- Do not break the existing Features or Industries mega menus.
- Do not alter the hero carousel or pricing components.
- Do not change button styles globally.

The output of this task should be:
1. New component: src/components/nav/ResourcesMegaMenu.tsx with the full 3-column dropdown as described.
2. Updated header/nav to include this Resources menu item using the same hover/focus/toggle logic as Features/Industries.
3. All <Link> targets wired:
   - /resources
   - /blog
   - /guides
   - /webinars  (placeholder route is okay)
   - /help
   - /contact
   - /signup
4. All accessibility / focus-visible rings present.
5. Mobile layout collapses to single-column stacks with full-width tap targets.
```

–––
What this gives you:

* The Resources dropdown now feels as “real” and mature as your Features and Industries dropdowns.
* On desktop it looks like you run an actual platform with training, support, onboarding, and sales enablement.
* On mobile it’s still usable with thumbs.

After Replit adds this, you’ll have a fully consistent nav story: Product, Industries, Resources all feel first-class.
