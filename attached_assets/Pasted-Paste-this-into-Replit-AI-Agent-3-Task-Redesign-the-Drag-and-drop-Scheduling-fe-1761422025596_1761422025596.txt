## Task

Redesign the **Drag-and-drop Scheduling** feature page as a high-converting landing page for searches like “HVAC company scheduling software.” Mobile-first, sharp corners, high contrast, no horizontal scroll at 375px. Every section starts with **Title + Subtitle** at top-left. Use rectangle buttons with bold labels. Add sticky bottom CTA and an inline lead form. Keep tone practical for contractors.

## Visual + interaction rules

* Grid: mobile 1-col, ≥768px two-col where specified, ≥1024px three-col for tiles.
* Cards: white bg, 1px slate-200 ring, `.elev-2` shadow, 16–24px padding.

* KPI tiles: value big, label small. Use neutral gray except success green up, info blue neutral.

## SEO + schema

* `<title>`: “Drag-and-drop Scheduling • Field Service Software”
* Meta description (≤160): “Move jobs on a live calendar, auto-notify crews, and cut drive time. Built for HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and more.”
* Canonical to this URL. OG tags. JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication`.
* Add `FAQPage` schema for the FAQ items below.

## Copy to render (use verbatim)

### 1) Hero band

* **Title:** Drag-and-drop Scheduling
* **Subtitle:** Schedule faster and keep crews in sync.
* **KPIs (show 3 tiles):**

  * `−18%` — Drive time
  * `+1.3` — Jobs per tech per day
  * `96%` — On-time arrival
* **Primary CTA buttons:** Start Free (primary), View Pricing (secondary)

### 2) What it does

* **Bullets (action → outcome):**

  * Drag jobs on a live calendar → crews and customers auto-notified.
  * Assign crews and vehicles → no double-booking.
  * See day, week, and route capacity → prevent overtime.

### 3) Why teams switch (Pain → Solve)

* **Pain list (left):**

  * Spreadsheets break when multiple people edit.
  * Office can’t see who’s free across all crews.
  * Techs get double-booked or sent to wrong locations.
  * Overtime surprises on Fridays.
* **Solve list (right):**

  * Real-time calendar with conflict warnings.
  * Color-coded availability by crew and vehicle.
  * Drag once → everyone gets notified (SMS/email).
  * Capacity view with hour caps and overtime alerts.

### 4) How it works (3 steps)

* **Step 1:** Create job — add photos, line items, and service window.
* **Step 2:** Place on calendar — drag to day; assign crew and truck.
* **Step 3:** Notify — customers and techs get the updated time automatically.

### 5) In the field (testimonial)

* Quote: “We reshuffle routes in minutes and cut callbacks.”
* Attribution: Mike R., Owner, HVAC

### 6) Works with (integrations chips)

* Show: QuickBooks, Xero, LinkInspectPro, PropertyLinkWare, SMS/Email

### 7) Mini demo + lead capture

* Left: “See it in 60 seconds” mock (image/video placeholder 16:9) with 3 captions:

  * Live calendar with conflict flags
  * Drag to assign crew and vehicle
  * Auto text to customer
* Right: **Lead form** (email + company) titled “See it with your jobs.” Button: **Book a demo**. One-line success: “Thanks — we’ll reach out within one business day.”

### 8) Related features (3 cards)

* Dispatch Board + Live Map — See every crew on screen.
* Route Optimization — Shortest routes, more jobs per tech.
* Capacity Planning — Balance workload and prevent overtime.

### 9) FAQ (accordion, max 6)

* **How long does setup take?** Most teams import in under a day.
* **Can I reschedule from my phone?** Yes. iOS and Android supported.
* **Will crews get alerts?** Yes. Techs and customers receive SMS/email.
* **What if I double-book?** You’ll see a conflict flag before saving.
* **Does it handle recurring jobs?** Yes. Daily, weekly, monthly patterns.
* **Does it work offline?** The mobile app queues updates and syncs later.

### 10) Bottom CTA band

* Headline: Ready to try it?
* Subcopy: Simple pricing. No contracts.
* Buttons: View Pricing (secondary), Start Free (primary)

### 11) Sticky bottom CTA (always visible on scroll)
