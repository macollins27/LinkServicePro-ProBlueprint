Now we build the **Job Costing & Reporting** page.

This page is for the owner / GM who actually cares about money, not just “nice features.” This person wants to know: “Which jobs are profitable? Which techs are dragging margin down? Where am I bleeding on labor and materials?” None of your small competitors speak to this well. ServiceTitan does, but bloats it. You’re going to speak like a straight shooter.

We target high-intent keywords like:

* “job costing software for field service”
* “HVAC job profitability tracking”
* “track labor and material cost per job”
* “field service reporting dashboard”
* “technician performance reporting”

Same output pattern:

* Part A: Page spec (copy/sections)
* Part B: Replit implementation block (you paste it and Replit builds it)

## A. PAGE SPEC: Job Costing & Reporting

ROUTE / SLUG
`/features/job-costing-reporting`

META

* `<title>`: “Job Costing & Profit Reporting | See Profit Per Job, Per Tech, Per Day”
* `<meta name="description">`: “Know exactly what each job actually made after labor, drive time, and materials. Track wage cost, parts cost, purchase orders, and vendor status. Stop guessing which work is worth it.”

PRIMARY SEO INTENT

* “job costing for field service”
* “HVAC job costing software”
* “track profit per job”
* “field service reporting dashboard”
* “technician profitability tracking”

H1 (hero heading)
“See profit per job, per tech, per day.”

Hero Subhead
“Stop guessing. Track labor cost, material cost, drive time, and price. Know which work is actually worth doing — and which you should stop offering.”

CORE MESSAGE TO HAMMER:

* You finally see the truth: margin per job, per tech.
* You stop doing money-loser work.
* You tighten wages, routes, and pricing based on data — not emotion.

PAGE STRUCTURE (4 sections + final CTA band):

1. HERO (dark slate/near-black)
2. TRUE JOB COSTING (spotlight card)
3. PAYROLL / LABOR / MATERIALS VISIBILITY
4. PURCHASING & VENDOR CONTROL
5. FINAL CTA BAND

We’re slightly changing palette in the hero and one section to match “financial control”: darker, serious, authority. We’ll use `bg-slate-900` instead of `#0E2A47` for the hero on THIS page only to make it feel “money & control.” Still keep brand cohesion for CTAs, buttons, etc.

## B. REPLIT IMPLEMENTATION BLOCK

Paste the following into Replit:

1. Create a new page component at `/features/job-costing-reporting`. Follow the same Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui conventions as the other feature pages. Do not touch global header/nav/footer.

2. Add `<Head>` with:

   ```html
   <title>Job Costing & Profit Reporting | See Profit Per Job, Per Tech, Per Day</title>
   <meta name="description" content="Know exactly what each job actually made after labor, drive time, and materials. Track wage cost, parts cost, purchase orders, and vendor status. Stop guessing which work is worth it." />
   ```

   Add JSON-LD structured data `SoftwareApplication`:

   * name: "LinkServicePro Job Costing & Reporting"
   * applicationCategory: "Field service management software"
   * offers.description: "Start free. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."

4. Shared component / a11y rules (must match prior pages):

   * Spotlight card wrapper (light):
     `relative bg-white ring-1 ring-slate-200 rounded-xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition duration-150 ease-out motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:transform-none motion-reduce:hover:shadow-sm p-5`
   * Dark spotlight card wrapper (if used in future pages):
     same as we used in Invoicing & Payments profit section, but not required here except hero/trust blocks.
   * `<PlanRibbon plan="..." />` is `absolute -top-2 -right-2 z-20`.
   * Eyebrow chip pills are always above the card headline.
   * Bullets are flex rows with:

     * Icon: `text-[#0B5FFF] w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0` `aria-hidden="true"`
     * Text block:

       * Title: `text-sm font-medium text-slate-700` (or `text-white` in dark sections)
       * Support: `text-[13px] leading-snug text-slate-500` (or `text-white/60` in dark sections)
   * For bullets in Section 3 with plan chips, append tiny pill:
     `inline-block bg-slate-200 text-slate-700 text-[10px] font-medium rounded-full px-1.5 py-[1px] ml-2`
   * Outcome Rows (right columns where specified) are NOT cards. They’re just icon + headline + supporting copy.
   * All CTAs (buttons and important links) must have visible focus state:
     `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none`
   * Semantic headings:

     * H1 only in Section 1.
     * All other major section headings should be `<h2>`.
   * Maintain WCAG AA contrast on all backgrounds.

5. Internal linking (MANDATORY):

   * “See Invoicing & Payments →” → `/features/invoicing-payments`
   * “View Scheduling & Dispatch →” → `/features/scheduling-dispatch`
   * “See Team Management” → `/features/team-management`
     These must be present so Google and AI connect profitability to ops, dispatch, and crew control.

6. Critical phrases that MUST appear exactly:

   * “See profit per job, per tech, per day.”
   * “Know if you actually made money on that job.”
   * “Every dollar accounted for.”
   * “Where did the money go?”
   * “No more ‘we’re out of parts’ surprises.”
   * “Run the jobs that pay. Drop the ones that don’t.”
   * “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”

After this page is done, the final core feature page we need to ship is **Team Management / Multi-team Control**, which sells foreman access, role permissions, assignments, and accountability. Say “next” and I’ll generate that.
