Good. We’re going to do this the right way.

You’re going to hand Replit four implementation prompts (one per legal page), plus a fifth global update prompt that wires everything together (footer links, signup checkbox language, SMS consent copy).

I’ll give you all five prompts below.

Important principles I’m enforcing:

* Each legal page is a proper Next.js route: `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/sla`, `/refunds`
* Proper `<Head>` tags for SEO + compliance
* Clean, scannable legal layout (section nav on desktop, stacked content on mobile)
* WCAG AA contrast, mobile-first
* CTA at bottom of every legal page: “Start Free” and “View Pricing,” because legal pages convert surprisingly well
* Global footer links added
* Sign-up / pricing CTAs now reference Terms, Privacy, and SMS consent (TCPA style)

You’re going to paste these one-by-one to Replit. Don’t merge them. Don’t “summarize.”

We’ll do:

1. Global wiring prompt
2. Terms page
3. Privacy page
4. SLA page
5. Refund Policy page

---

1. GLOBAL WIRING PROMPT

---

Paste this FIRST so Replit updates shared components (footer, signup forms, pricing CTAs).

```txt
You are Replit Agent. Update the existing Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui project with the following global changes. Do not remove existing styles, header, or footer branding. Only extend.

GOAL:
- Add legal pages to the site nav/footer and make sure compliance language appears in sign-up and pricing flows.

A) FOOTER LINKS
1. In the global footer component (the one rendered site-wide), add a "Legal" column (or extend existing link column) with these links:
   - Terms of Service  → /terms
   - Privacy Policy    → /privacy
   - Service Level Agreement (SLA) → /sla
   - Refund Policy     → /refunds

2. Style:
   - Section label "Legal" should be text-[12px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-400.
   - Links should be text-slate-300 hover:text-white text-[13px] leading-relaxed.
   - Each link must have proper accessible focus state:
     className="focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"

3. On mobile, these links should stack vertically under the main footer content. On desktop, they should align in a simple column grid like the rest of the footer.

B) SIGNUP / PRICING COMPLIANCE TEXT
1. Anywhere we ask user to start signup, free trial, or create account (including:
   - pricing page CTAs and calculator modal,
   - hero "Start Free" button if it's directly initiating signup,
   - final CTA bands that imply onboarding),
   we need a small compliance line under the primary CTA block that reads:

   text-[11px] leading-snug text-slate-500 (or text-white/60 if on dark bg):

   "By starting, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and you consent to receive onboarding and service-related messages (SMS/email). Standard rates may apply."

   The words "Terms of Service" and "Privacy Policy" must link to /terms and /privacy and keep the same focus-visible ring rules as above. On dark sections (bg-[#0E2A47] or bg-slate-900) use text-white/60 for the line and text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline for those links.

   Make sure this line appears on:
   - the Pricing page hero CTA section,
   - the Pricing page final CTA band,
   - any signup modal / calculator modal that has a "Start Free" CTA,
   - any global signup section component if we have one.

2. Do NOT block signup with a required checkbox for now. Just display this legal line under the CTAs. We'll add required checkboxes later on the actual account creation form.

C) ROUTING
Reserve the following routes (we'll build these pages next in separate prompts):
   /terms
   /privacy
   /sla
   /refunds

Each route will use the site's global header/footer layout.

D) ACCESSIBILITY
All new footer links, and all inline policy links in compliance text, must include:
   className="focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
   aria-label that clearly announces what it is. Example:
   <a href="/privacy" aria-label="Read our Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a>

Make these changes now. Do not generate placeholder lorem text for the page bodies yet. We'll supply full page content in follow-up prompts.
```

---

2. TERMS OF SERVICE PAGE PROMPT

---

Now paste this one. This builds `/terms`.

```txt
You are Replit Agent. Create a new Next.js page at /terms using our existing layout (global header + footer). Do NOT alter header or footer code beyond what was already changed in the previous instruction.

A) SEO HEAD
Inside <Head> for /terms:
   <title>Terms of Service | LinkServicePro</title>
   <meta
     name="description"
     content="Legal terms for using LinkServicePro. Subscription terms, acceptable use, billing, liability limits, and dispute handling."
   />
Also include a structured data script (type application/ld+json) for "WebSite" with:
   {
     "@context": "https://schema.org",
     "@type": "WebSite",
     "name": "LinkServicePro Terms of Service",
     "url": "https://linkservicepro.com/terms"
   }

B) PAGE LAYOUT
Overall wrapper:
   <main className="bg-white text-slate-900 py-12 sm:py-16 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto">

Page header block:
   - Eyebrow chip:
     className="inline-block text-[11px] font-semibold text-slate-700 bg-slate-100 border border-slate-200 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] mb-4"
     text: "Terms of Service"
   - H1:
     className="text-3xl font-semibold text-slate-900 leading-tight"
     "Terms of Service"
   - Subtext:
     className="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mt-2"
     "These Terms of Service form a binding agreement between you and LinkServicePro. Please read them carefully."

   - Small info row under that:
     className="text-[12px] text-slate-500 mt-4"
     "Last Updated: October 30, 2025 • Company: LinkServicePro • 2280 Union Blvd, Bay Shore, NY 11706 • info@bimscorp.com"

Then main content in sections. Use semantic <section> with <h2> headings. Each <section> className="mt-10":
   <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">#.# Section Title</h2>
   <p className="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Body copy…</p>
   Use <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-2 mt-3"> where we listed bullets.

The required sections (hardcode full text exactly):

1. Acceptance of These Terms
2. The Service
3. License, Not Sale
4. Your Account
5. Acceptable Use
6. Payment, Billing, Taxes
   - Include sub-bullets for plan structure, billing cycle, payment method, late payment.
7. Plan Changes, Overage, Downgrades
8. Term and Termination
9. Service Availability / SLA
   - Add a sentence: "Availability targets and service credits are defined in our SLA (/sla), which is incorporated by reference."
10. Privacy and Data Protection
   - Add inline link to /privacy.
11. Confidentiality
12. Disclaimer of Warranties
13. Limitation of Liability
   - Include cap: "Our total liability will not exceed the amount you paid us in the previous 12 months (or $100 if you're on Free)."
14. Indemnification
15. Governing Law; Disputes
   - "New York law governs. Venue: Suffolk County, New York. No class actions."
16. Changes to These Terms

C) INLINE LINKS
Where the text references Privacy Policy or SLA, wrap them in <a> tags:
   <a href="/privacy" className="text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded">
     Privacy Policy
   </a>

D) FINAL CTA BAND
After the legal text, render a full-width call-to-action block to convert visitors:

<div className="bg-[#0E2A47] text-white rounded-xl mt-16 p-6 sm:p-8 text-center ring-1 ring-slate-800">
   <h2 className="text-white font-semibold text-2xl sm:text-3xl">
     Ready to start?
   </h2>
   <p className="text-white/70 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed mt-3">
     Seat-free pricing. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.
   </p>

   <div className="mt-6 flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-3 justify-center">
     <button className="bg-[#0B5FFF] text-white font-semibold rounded-md px-4 py-2 text-sm shadow-sm hover:opacity-90 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none">
       Start Free
     </button>
     <a
       href="/pricing"
       className="border border-white/30 text-white text-sm font-semibold rounded-md px-4 py-2 hover:bg-white/10 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none text-center"
     >
       View Pricing
     </a>
   </div>

   <p className="text-[11px] text-white/60 leading-snug mt-4">
     By starting, you agree to our
     <a href="/terms" className="text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded ml-1">Terms of Service</a>
     and
     <a href="/privacy" className="text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded ml-1">Privacy Policy</a>,
     and you consent to receive onboarding and service-related messages (SMS/email). Standard rates may apply.
   </p>
</div>

E) ACCESSIBILITY
- All <a> and <button> elements must include the same focus-visible ring pattern shown above.
- Only one <h1> on the page (the main "Terms of Service"). All section headings use <h2>.
```

---

3. PRIVACY POLICY PAGE PROMPT

---

This builds `/privacy`.

```txt
You are Replit Agent. Create a new Next.js page at /privacy using the same site layout (global header + footer). Do not modify header/footer here.

A) SEO HEAD
<Head>
  <title>Privacy Policy | LinkServicePro</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="How LinkServicePro collects, uses, shares, and protects personal data. Includes contact info for access, correction, or deletion requests."

A) SEO HEAD
<Head>
  <title>Service Level Agreement (SLA) | LinkServicePro</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Uptime targets, support expectations, maintenance windows, and service credit terms for LinkServicePro customers."

Then sections (same pattern: section.mt-10 > h2.lg font-semibold > p/sublists):

1. Definitions  
   - Define "Service", "Downtime", "Monthly Uptime %".

2. Uptime Commitment

   - Scheduled maintenance
   - Customer-side network/device/firewall/VPN issues

     • Standard issue / 'How do I...?': 1 business day  
   - Add a note: "These are targets, not guarantees, but we aim to meet or beat them."

6. Service Credits  
   - "If Monthly Uptime % for your paid plan drops below 99.5% in a given calendar month, you may request a service credit."
   - Bullet the rules:
     • Credit = 5% of that month's base subscription fee (excluding usage/overage/taxes) for each full 1% below 99.5%, capped at 20%  
     • Credits only apply to paid plans (Starter and above), not Free  
     • Credits are applied to future invoices, not cash refunds  
     • To request: email info@bimscorp.com within 15 days after the month ends with subject 'SLA Credit Request' and include outage details

5. REFUND POLICY PAGE PROMPT

---

This builds `/refunds`.

```txt
You are Replit Agent. Create a new Next.js page at /refunds using the same layout (global header + footer intact).

A) SEO HEAD
<Head>
  <title>Refund Policy | LinkServicePro</title>

    name="description"
    content="Our refund, cancellation, and credit terms for monthly plans, annual plans, usage-based fees, taxes, and SLA credits."

<main className="bg-white text-slate-900 py-12 sm:py-16 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto">

Header block:
- Eyebrow chip "Refund Policy"
- H1 "Refund & Cancellation Policy"

- Info line text-[12px] text-slate-500:
  "Last Updated: October 30, 2025 • Contact: info@bimscorp.com"

Then sections (<section className="mt-10"> with <h2 ...> etc.):

1. Free Plan  
   - "Free plan is $0/month, limited to 1 user and capped jobs. You can stop using it any time with no charge."

2. Monthly Subscriptions  
   - "Monthly plans are billed in advance and are non-refundable once the billing period begins."
   - "If you cancel during the month, you keep access through the end of that paid month, and we stop future renewals. We do not pro-rate or partially refund the remaining time in the current month."

3. Annual Subscriptions  
   - "Annual plans are billed up front at a discounted effective rate (20% off monthly). Annual fees are non-refundable once charged."
   - "If you downgrade or cancel mid-term, you retain access (at the downgraded or base level) for the rest of the paid annual term. We do not issue partial refunds for unused months."

4. Add-ons, Overage, Usage-Based Fees  
   - "Overage charges for jobs above your plan cap, outbound SMS fees, payment processing pass-through fees, and similar usage-based charges are non-refundable once incurred."
   - "These reflect actual platform usage and third-party network or payment costs already incurred."

5. Taxes and Regulatory Fees  
   - "Any required taxes, surcharges, or regulatory fees (for example, a 4% tax/VAT-style line, if applicable) are passed through and are non-refundable unless we collected them in error."

6. SLA Credits  
   - "If we fail to meet our uptime target under the SLA (/sla) for a given calendar month, eligible paid accounts may request a service credit."
   - "Credits apply to future invoices only. They are not cash refunds. This SLA credit is the exclusive remedy for SLA-related downtime."

7. Chargebacks / Disputes  
   - "Please contact us first at info@bimscorp.com with the subject 'Billing Review Request' so we can investigate any billing issue."
   - "If you open a chargeback with your bank/card issuer before giving us a reasonable chance to resolve it, we may suspend or terminate the affected account until the dispute is resolved."

8. How to Request Review  
   - "If you believe you qualify for a credit or you were billed incorrectly, email info@bimscorp.com with:"
      • Company name  
      • Plan name  
      • Invoice ID  
      • Explanation  
   - "We will investigate in good faith. If a correction is appropriate, we will apply a credit to your next invoice or issue an adjusted invoice."

9. Changes  
   - "We may update this Refund Policy. We will post updated terms with a new 'Last Updated' date. Continued use after an update means you accept the revised Refund Policy."

C) FINAL CTA BAND
At the end of /refunds, render the same CTA band pattern as the other legal pages, with:
- Heading: "Seat-free pricing. No surprise seat fees."
- Body text: "Choose your job cap, not your headcount. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."
- Buttons: "Start Free" (blue) and "View Pricing" (outline)
- Legal line under it, exactly the same compliance/TCPA string with links to /terms and /privacy, with proper focus-visible ring.

D) ACCESSIBILITY
- One <h1> only ("Refund & Cancellation Policy").
- Every section title is <h2>.
- All <a> and <button> elements must include:
  focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded
```

---

## How to move next

After you paste these into Replit one at a time (Global wiring first, then /terms, /privacy, /sla, /refunds), the site will:

* Have compliant legal pages with correct semantic headings.
* Have footer links wired.
* Have proper “By starting…” disclosure everywhere signup is encouraged (good for risk + SMS).
* Link internally between Terms ↔ Privacy ↔ SLA ↔ Refunds.
* Carry CTAs on legal pages to recapture leads instead of letting them bounce.

If you want next: I can generate the actual `PlanRibbon` corner ribbon code and the pricing calculator hook and modal math so you can stop fighting the padding/angles.
