You’re right—contrast has to be effortless. Let’s restart the second section with a **crisp, light band** that cleanly contrasts your dark hero, keeps copy ultra-clear, and uses premium details without visual noise.

Below is a **drop-in prompt for Replit Agent 3**. It creates a brand-new section under the hero. It does not touch the hero or the carousel.

---

## Replace the next section with **“Value Pillars — Light”**

**Scope:** Add a new section directly below the hero. Remove the previous “Connected Outcomes” attempt. Do **not** modify the hero or the carousel.

### Visual goals (high contrast, calm, premium)

* Section background: pure **white** for maximum contrast with the dark hero.
* Text color: deep navy `#0A1326` (not gray) for strong legibility.
* Card background: white. Border: `#E6EAF2`. Subtle inner shadow on hover only.
* Accent: primary blue `#2D6BFF` with hover `#255AE0`.
* No gradients behind text. No low-contrast overlays.

### Content (plain language, no abbreviations)

* Title: **“Everything you need in one place”**

* Subtitle: *Plan the day, send estimates, and collect payments without switching tools.*

* Three cards with short intro + three bullets + CTA button on each:

  1. **Schedule and dispatch**
     Intro: *Assign jobs to the right person in minutes.*
     Bullets:

     * *Drag and drop jobs onto the schedule.*
     * *Match by skills, distance, and priority.*
     * *Give every technician the plan on their phone.*
       CTA: **See scheduling** → `/features/scheduling`
  2. **Send estimates and get approval**
     Intro: *Create clear estimates on site or in the office.*
     Bullets:

     * *Use saved items and prices to build fast.*
     * *Send by email and text with one click.*
     * *Customers approve online without a call.*
       CTA: **See estimates** → `/features/estimates`
  3. **Invoice and get paid**
     Intro: *Create an invoice and collect payment the same day.*
     Bullets:

     * *Accept cards and bank payments securely.*
     * *Send receipts and keep records in one place.*
     * *Track what is due and what is paid.*
       CTA: **See payments** → `/features/payments`

* Section-level CTA at bottom: **Start your trial** → `/signup`

### Layout & spacing

* Section padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16 sm:py-20 lg:py-24`.
* Grid: `1 / 2 / 3` cards across breakpoints.
* Card padding: `p-6 sm:p-7 lg:p-8`.
* Tight typographic scale for clarity:

  * H2: `text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-semibold`
  * Intro text: `text-lg text-[#334155]`
  * Card title: `text-xl font-semibold text-[#0A1326]`
  * Body: `text-[#1F2937]`
* Subtle uniqueness: a thin **blue top border** on each card (2px) that aligns across the grid, giving a “product line” feel without distraction.

### Accessibility

* `<section aria-labelledby="pillars-title">`
* Button focus rings visible (`ring-2 ring-[#2D6BFF] ring-offset-2`).
* Icons marked `aria-hidden="true"` if used.
* Color contrast AA+ verified (dark text on white; blue buttons on white).

### Placement

* Import and render `<ValuePillarsLight />` directly **after** the hero section.
* Remove the previous outcomes section component so there is only one immediate light band.

### Why this will read and convert better

* **Hard contrast**: white band under dark hero makes the next story obvious.
* **Legible colors**: deep navy headings and black-on-white body text avoid the washed contrast you saw.
* **Premium restraint**: crisp borders, a single blue line, and clean spacing signal quality without gimmicks.
* **Every card has a CTA** and a bottom CTA to catch high intent.

If this look feels right once you see it live, we’ll lock these color tokens and card patterns into the site-wide template so every page keeps the same contrast and CTA rhythm.
