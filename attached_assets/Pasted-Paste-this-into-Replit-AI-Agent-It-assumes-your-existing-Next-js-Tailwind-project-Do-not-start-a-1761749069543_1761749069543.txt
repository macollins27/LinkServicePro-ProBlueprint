Paste this into Replit AI Agent. It assumes your existing Next.js + Tailwind project. Do not start a new app; refactor in place.

---

## OBJECTIVE

Refactor the existing **Link Service Pro** marketing site in-place. Keep routing and deployment. Ship a clean, fast, accessible, mobile-first homepage and shared components per the spec below. Replace generic sections with an interactive product tour, industry carousel, differentiated hero, transparent pricing with a calculator modal, and a tight integrations band. Use gray placeholder images where needed.

## TECH BASELINE

### 3) Data (`data/`)

* `plans.ts` — **single source of truth**

  * Plans:

    * Free — 1 user, 30 jobs — $0
    * Starter — unlimited users, 50 jobs — $29
    * Essential — unlimited users, 150 jobs — $79
    * Premium — unlimited users, 500 jobs — $179
    * Platinum — unlimited users, unlimited jobs — $399
  * Overages: Starter $0.60/job, Essential $0.45/job, Premium $0.30/job
  * Annual discount: 20%
  * Tax: 4%
  * GPS limits: Essential (2 vehicles, read-only map), Premium (10 vehicles), Platinum (unlimited)
  * Helpers: `planForJobs`, `calcBase`, `calcOverage`, `calcProcessing`, `calcSms`, `calcTax`, `calcTotals`
* `features.ts` — label, description, minPlan, icon, link slug
* `industries.ts` — list of 9 trades with slugs, 1-line benefit
* `faq.ts` — 6 common questions/answers for accordion and FAQ schema

### 4) API routes (`app/api/`)

* `/trial/route.ts` — 2-step trial submit; Zod validation; recaptcha check; send mail to SALES_ALERT_EMAIL (env) and respond 200.
* `/contact/route.ts` — contact sales submit; same safeguards.
* `/newsletter/route.ts` — Mailchimp subscribe with env placeholders.

### 5) SEO + Schema

* `app/robots.txt`, `app/sitemap.ts`
* Use `generateMetadata` per route with:

  * **Title:** “Field Service Software for Contractors | Link Service Pro”
  * **Description:** “Run jobs faster with simple scheduling, estimates, messaging, and payments. Unlimited users on paid plans. Works with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.”
* JSON-LD on homepage:

  * `Organization`, `SoftwareApplication`, `Product`, `FAQPage`, `VideoObject`, `BreadcrumbList`, `Review` (placeholders safe).
* Add FAQ accordion content to schema.

### 6) Accessibility

* Enforce WCAG AA contrast.
* All interactive components keyboard-navigable (Tabs, Carousels, Dialog).
* Visible focus rings per token spec.
* `aria-label`/`aria-controls` on carousel and tabs; `role="dialog"` on modal.

### 7) Performance

* `next/image` with `priority` for hero; lazy for others; `sizes` attributes set.
* Preconnect to Mailchimp and Stripe.
* Use WebP/AVIF for placeholders.
* Defer non-critical scripts; tree-shake shadcn imports.

  * Tabs can be switched via keyboard
  * Pricing calculator computes totals for: 40, 120, 520 jobs/mo and matches plan+overage rules
  * Forms validate and submit to API routes (mocked)

**Important constraints**

* **Do not** rebuild from scratch. **Refactor existing pages and components in-place.**
* **Do not** mention lack of accounting integrations anywhere; only show “Accounting integrations: coming soon.”
* Use gray placeholders for all imagery until assets arrive.
* Keep copy contractor-focused and concise; no clipboards/paper in visuals.

Deliver the modified codebase with all components, data, routes, styles, and tests updated to match this spec.
