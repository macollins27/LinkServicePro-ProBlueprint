Locked in. This next page is **Invoicing & Payments**.

This page must do two things:

1. Convert the owner who’s sick of chasing money.
2. Position you as the system that gets them paid fast and proves profit.

People search for “field service invoicing software,” “take card payment in the field,” “HVAC invoicing app,” “batch invoicing,” “job costing.” This page needs to hit all of that, clearly, without fluff.

Same format as before:

* Part A: Page spec (copy and structure for `/features/invoicing-payments`)
* Part B: Replit instructions (paste directly to Replit and they build it)

We continue the visual system you’ve already committed to:

* Dark navy hero
* Spotlight cards with PlanRibbon
* Light/dark section alternation
* CTA every section
* Internal linking to profit/costing page

   SECTION 5. FINAL CTA BAND (bg-[#0E2A47] text-white)

   * Centered wrapper max-w-3xl.
   * Heading: “Get paid without chasing.”
   * Subtext: “Batch invoices. Take card in the field. Show customers a portal instead of blowing up their phone. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”
   * CTA row:

     * Primary button (blue #0B5FFF): “Start Free”
     * Secondary outline (border-white/30): “View Pricing”
   * TCPA line: “By starting, you agree to receive onboarding and service-related messages. Standard rates apply for SMS usage.”
   * All interactive elements must have visible `focus-visible` rings:
     `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none`

4. Components & styling:

   * Spotlight cards in sections 2 and 3 use the light card style; spotlight card in section 4 uses the dark card style.
   * Every spotlight card must include a PlanRibbon (`<PlanRibbon plan="..."/>`) in the top-right, positioned with `absolute -top-2 -right-2 z-20`.
   * Eyebrow chip pill sits above each spotlight headline.
   * Bullet rows are flex with:

     * Icon `text-[#0B5FFF] w-5 h-5 flex-shrink-0` `aria-hidden="true"`
     * Text wrapper:

       * Title: `text-sm font-medium`
       * Support: `text-[13px] leading-snug` in slate-500 for light sections, white/60 for dark sections.
   * Outcome rows on the right side of section 2 are NOT cards (no border, no ribbon). They’re just icon + bold text + one-line supporting copy.
   * The “customer portal” spotlight card in section 3 must include the gray placeholder box for now instead of a real screenshot.

5. Messaging that MUST appear as-is on this page:

   * “Invoice on the spot. Get paid in hours, not days.”
   * “Send an invoice and take payment before you leave the driveway.”
   * “Your customer always knows what they owe.”
   * “See profit per job, per tech, per day.”
   * “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”
   * “Stop doing work that isn’t worth it.”
   * Do not water this down.

6. Accessibility / semantics:

   * Section 1 headline is the only `<h1>`.
   * All other major section headlines should be `<h2>`.
   * Icons include `aria-hidden="true"`.
   * Buttons and important links have visible focus state using our standard ring.
   * Contrast must remain WCAG AA (dark navy #0E2A47 with white text is OK, bg-slate-50 with slate-900 is OK, bg-slate-900 with white is OK).

7. Internal linking:

   * In section 2 right column:
     “See Estimates & Quotes →” → `/features/estimates-quotes`
   * In section 4 right column CTA block:
     “See Job Costing & Reporting” → `/features/job-costing-reporting`
     “View Scheduling & Dispatch →” → `/features/scheduling-dispatch`
     These internal links are mandatory for SEO crawl depth and cross-page authority.

After this is implemented, you’ll have four cornerstone feature pages:

* Scheduling & Dispatch
* Work Orders & Mobile
* Estimates & Quotes
* Invoicing & Payments

Next, we’ll build **Customer Communication & Reminders**, unless you’d rather jump straight to “Job Costing & Reporting.”
