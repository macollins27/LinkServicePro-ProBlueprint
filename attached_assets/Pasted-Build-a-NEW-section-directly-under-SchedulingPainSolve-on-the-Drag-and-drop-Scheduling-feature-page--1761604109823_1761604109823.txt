Build a NEW section directly under SchedulingPainSolve on the Drag-and-drop Scheduling feature page.

Section name: “SchedulingRouteImpact”
File: src/sections/SchedulingRouteImpact.tsx
Insert: import and render immediately after SchedulingPainSolve in src/routes/features/scheduling.tsx

Stack: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, shadcn/ui (Radix), Wouter, TanStack Query.
Theme: “Pro-Blueprint” (sharp corners, rivet borders, optional blueprint grid).
A11y: WCAG AA+, keyboard-friendly, aria-live where needed.
Mobile-first: 375px one column; ≥640px two columns.

GOAL
Show the WOW of drag-and-drop by visualizing the route and time impact in real time. Convert with standardized buttons.

SECTION CONTENT
Header
- H2: “Route smart. Not hard.”
- Sub: “See drive time, ETAs, and crew load adjust the moment you drag.”

Left: Mini Map + Route Delta
- A simple stylized map panel (no external map SDK) with:
  * Polyline route
  * 3 tech pins (T1, T2, T3) and today’s stops as numbered dots
  * On scenario change, animate line length and ETA badges (respect prefers-reduced-motion)
- Scenario selector (3 buttons as small tabs):
  1) “Reassign job to Tech 2”
  2) “Pull 3 PM to 11:30 AM”
  3) “Cluster nearby stops”
- When a scenario is selected, update the right-side metrics and this map:
  * Shorter or longer polyline
  * Badge near end point: “ETA 2:10 PM → 1:58 PM (−12m)”
  * Floating badges on pins: T1/T2 utilization %

Right: Impact Cards + CTA
- Three impact cards update per scenario (use the exact strings):
  * “Drive time −12 min”
  * “On-time window +8%”
  * “Crew load balanced”
- A compact change log list (max 3 items):
  * Example entries:
    - “Moved Leak Repair to Tech 2”
    - “ETA text sent to customer”
    - “Route resequenced A→B→C”
- CTA block uses standardized buttons from src/components/Buttons.tsx:
  * Primary: <StartFreeButton context="light" />
  * Secondary: <ViewPricingButton context="light" />
  * Place inside a responsive ButtonsRow with 12px gap; column on mobile, row on ≥640px.

COPY (use verbatim)
- H2: “Route smart. Not hard.”
- Sub: “See drive time, ETAs, and crew load adjust the moment you drag.”
- Scenario tabs:
  1) “Reassign job to Tech 2”
  2) “Pull 3 PM to 11:30 AM”
  3) “Cluster nearby stops”
- Impact cards (always three):
  * “Drive time −12 min”
  * “On-time window +8%”
  * “Crew load balanced”
- Change log sample lines (rotate based on scenario):
  * “Moved Leak Repair to Tech 2”
  * “ETA text sent to customer”
  * “Route resequenced A→B→C”

ACCESSIBILITY
- Map container: role="img" aria-label="Route illustration updating with scheduling changes"
- Tabs: proper role="tablist" with roving tab index
- Announce metric changes via aria-live="polite" region (#impact-status)
- All focusable elements have visible focus ring using #0B5FFF

INTERACTION DETAILS
- No external map packages. Render a simple SVG:
  * Background grid or light streets (two-toned shapes)
  * Route polyline
  * Pins as sharp-cornered markers with “T1/T2/T3”
- On tab select:
  * Update a small state model for drive time delta, on-time %, crew load labels, and change log items
  * Update SVG path length (use stroke-dasharray trick if animating; guard with prefers-reduced-motion)
  * Write a short string to #impact-status: e.g., “Scenario applied: Reassign job to Tech 2. Drive time −12 min.”

STYLES
- Card shells: white, ring-1 slate-200, elev-2 shadow, square corners
- Accent colors: navy #0E2A47, blue #0B5FFF, green #0FB36F
- Optional blueprint background utility `bg-blueprint` allowed on map wrapper
- No rounded pills. No floating UI collages.

CODE REQUIREMENTS
- Export default function SchedulingRouteImpact(): JSX.Element
- Provide data-testid:
  * data-testid="scenario-tabs"
  * data-testid="map-svg"
  * data-testid="impact-drive"
  * data-testid="impact-ontime"
  * data-testid="impact-crew"
  * data-testid="cta-start-free"
- Import standardized buttons:
  import { StartFreeButton, ViewPricingButton, ButtonsRow } from "@/components/Buttons";
- Keep all strings and labels exactly as provided for copy consistency.

FILE SCAFFOLD (guide)
- src/sections/SchedulingRouteImpact.tsx
  * Local state: activeScenario: 0|1|2
  * Computed impact for each scenario (object array)
  * SVG map component with props from state
  * ImpactCards component
  * ChangeLog component
  * CTA block using ButtonsRow + StartFreeButton + ViewPricingButton
  * aria-live div id="impact-status"

QA GATES
- No horizontal overflow at 375px
- Lighthouse: ≥90 Performance, ≥95 Accessibility on this route section
- Tabs operable by keyboard (Left/Right to switch, Enter/Space to activate)
- Focus rings visible on tabs and buttons
- aria-live messages fire on scenario change
- Works with prefers-reduced-motion

OPTIONAL ASSET
- public/map-texture.svg lightweight pattern for the map background; ensure decorative (aria-hidden="true")
