Good catch from Replit. We're not going to argue with it — we adapt.

We’re doing **Option 1**:

* Keep your current stack: **React + Vite + Wouter + Helmet**
* Keep your routing style under `/legal/...`
* Keep your global footer component and signup CTAs, just extend them
* Keep all design, accessibility, copy, and compliance logic I already gave you

Now I’ll give you updated, stack-correct, paste-ready prompts for Replit:

1. Global wiring / footer / compliance text
2. `/legal/terms`
3. `/legal/privacy`
4. `/legal/sla`
5. `/legal/refund`

Each page will:

* Use `<Helmet>` for `<title>`, `<meta>`, and JSON-LD
* Use your shared header/footer layout wrapper (whatever root layout component you’re already using for pages)
* Use Wouter’s `<Link>` for internal navigation
* Follow your Tailwind system, color tokens, button styles, and focus-visible rings

You’re going to feed each prompt separately to Replit, in order.

## PROMPT 1. GLOBAL WIRING / FOOTER / COMPLIANCE

```txt
You are Replit Agent. We are working in a React + Vite + Wouter project (NOT Next.js). Do not replace the router. Do not refactor to Next.js. Only update components in-place.

GOAL
Add legal links in the site footer, reserve new routes under /legal/*, and inject compliance text under CTAs (pricing, signup, final CTA bands).

A) FOOTER
1. Find the global Footer component (the one rendered on every page).
2. Add a new "Legal" section in the footer links. If a column layout already exists, add a new column. If it's a single-column stack on mobile, ensure this appears like other link groups.
   - Heading:
     <div className="text-[12px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-400">Legal</div>
   - Links (use Wouter <Link>):
     • Terms of Service → /legal/terms
     • Privacy Policy → /legal/privacy
     • Service Level Agreement → /legal/sla
     • Refund Policy → /legal/refund

   Style each link:
   className="text-slate-300 hover:text-white text-[13px] leading-relaxed focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"

   Each Link should include aria-label, e.g.
   <Link
     href="/legal/privacy"
     aria-label="Read our Privacy Policy"
     className="..."
   >
     Privacy Policy
   </Link>

3. Mobile: links should stack vertically. Desktop: align consistently with other footer columns.

B) COMPLIANCE LINE UNDER CTAs
We need a small disclosure line under ANY UI that invites the user to start a trial, create an account, or otherwise "Start Free". That includes:
- Pricing page hero CTA area
- Pricing page final CTA band
- Any "Start Free" band at the bottom of feature pages or legal pages
- Signup modal / pricing calculator modal where "Start Free" appears

Implementation details:
1. Under the main CTA buttons, render this <p>:

<p className="text-[11px] leading-snug mt-4 text-slate-500 dark:text-white/60">
  By starting, you agree to our{" "}
  <Link
    href="/legal/terms"
    className="text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
    aria-label="Read our Terms of Service"
  >
    Terms of Service
  </Link>{" "}
  and{" "}
  <Link
    href="/legal/privacy"
    className="text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
    aria-label="Read our Privacy Policy"
  >
    Privacy Policy
  </Link>
  , and you consent to receive onboarding and service-related messages (SMS/email). Standard rates may apply.
</p>

2. On dark backgrounds (navy #0E2A47 or slate-900), ensure the <p> wrapper uses:
   className="text-[11px] leading-snug mt-4 text-white/60"
   and the <Link> elements inside use text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline (keep same focus-visible ring).

C) ROUTES
We are about to add pages under:
- /legal/terms
- /legal/privacy
- /legal/sla
- /legal/refund

Do NOT implement the pages yet in this step. Just make sure nothing in the footer or CTA crashes if those routes exist.

D) ACCESSIBILITY
All new footer links + inline policy links must include:
focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded

Make these changes now and stop.
```

---

## PROMPT 2. TERMS OF SERVICE PAGE (/legal/terms)

```txt
You are Replit Agent. Create a new React route component for /legal/terms using our existing stack (React + Vite + Wouter + Helmet). DO NOT convert the project to Next.js.

1. ROUTING
- Add a route path="/legal/terms" that renders <TermsPage /> (or similar).
- Make sure <TermsPage /> uses the site's normal page shell / layout (header + footer). Reuse whatever wrapper we use for other marketing pages (spacing, max-width, etc.). Do NOT break global header/footer.

2. SEO WITH HELMET
Inside TermsPage component, include:
<Helmet>
  <title>Terms of Service | LinkServicePro</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="Legal terms for using LinkServicePro. Subscription terms, acceptable use, billing, liability limits, and dispute handling."
  />
  <script type="application/ld+json">
    {`
      {
        "@context": "https://schema.org",
        "@type": "WebSite",
        "name": "LinkServicePro Terms of Service",
        "url": "https://linkservicepro.com/legal/terms"
      }
    `}
  </script>
</Helmet>

3. PAGE BODY LAYOUT
Structure:
<main className="bg-white text-slate-900 py-12 sm:py-16 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
  <!-- header block -->
  <!-- legal sections -->
  <!-- CTA band -->
</main>

HEADER BLOCK (render exactly):
- Eyebrow chip:
  <div className="inline-block text-[11px] font-semibold text-slate-700 bg-slate-100 border border-slate-200 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] mb-4">
    Terms of Service
  </div>

- H1:
  <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-slate-900 leading-tight">
    Terms of Service
  </h1>

- Subtext (small intro):
  <p className="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed max-w-2xl mt-2">
    These Terms of Service form a binding agreement between you and
    LinkServicePro. Please read them carefully.
  </p>

- Info row:
  <p className="text-[12px] text-slate-500 mt-4">
    Last Updated: October 30, 2025 • Company: LinkServicePro • 2280 Union Blvd,
    Bay Shore, NY 11706 • info@bimscorp.com
  </p>

4. LEGAL SECTIONS
After the header block, render multiple <section className="mt-10"> blocks.

Each section:
<section className="mt-10">
  <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">
    1. Acceptance of These Terms
  </h2>
  <p className="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">
    By creating an account, starting a free trial, or using LinkServicePro
    (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”).
    If you are using the Service on behalf of a company, you represent you have
    authority to bind that company, and “you” refers to that company. If you do
    not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.
  </p>
</section>

Then create additional <section> blocks for:
2. The Service  
3. License, Not Sale  
4. Your Account  
5. Acceptable Use  
6. Payment, Billing, Taxes  
   - Inside this section, include a <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-2 mt-3"> with bullets for: plan structure / billing cycle / payment method / late payment.

10. Privacy and Data Protection  
   - Mention that our Privacy Policy explains data collection and use.
   - Include inline <Link href="/legal/privacy" ...>Privacy Policy</Link> with same classes as above.
11. Confidentiality

Use <p className="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed"> inside each section.

5. CTA BAND AT BOTTOM
After the last <section>, render a full-width call-to-action card:

<div className="bg-[#0E2A47] text-white rounded-xl mt-16 p-6 sm:p-8 text-center ring-1 ring-slate-800">

You are Replit Agent. Create a new route component at /legal/refund (singular "refund"). Use the same React + Vite + Wouter + Helmet stack and global layout (header/footer).

1. ROUTING
Add path="/legal/refund" → <RefundPage />.

2. HELMET
<Helmet>
  <title>Refund Policy | LinkServicePro</title>
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="How billing, cancellations, credits, taxes, and SLA-related adjustments work for LinkServicePro subscriptions."
  />
  <script type="application/ld+json">
    {`
      {
        "@context": "https://schema.org",
        "@type": "PaymentChargeSpecification",
        "name": "LinkServicePro Refund Policy",
        "url": "https://linkservicepro.com/legal/refund",
        "priceCurrency": "USD"
      }

Render each as:
<section className="mt-10">
  <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900 mb-3">Section title…</h2>
  <p className="text-slate-600 text-sm leading-relaxed">Body…</p>
</section>

Required sections / content:

1. Free Plan  
   - "The Free plan is $0/month, limited to 1 user and a capped number of jobs. You can stop using it at any time."

2. Monthly Subscriptions  
   - "Monthly plans are billed in advance and are non-refundable once the billing period begins."
   - "If you cancel mid-month, you keep access until the end of that paid billing period, and we stop future renewals. We do not pro-rate or partially refund the unused portion of the current month."

3. Annual Subscriptions  
   - "Annual plans are billed up front at an effective discounted rate (20% off monthly). Annual fees are non-refundable once charged."
   - "If you downgrade or cancel mid-term, you retain access (at the downgraded or base level) for the remainder of the paid annual term. We do not issue partial refunds for unused months."

4. Add-ons, Overage, Usage-Based Fees  
   - "Overage fees for jobs above your plan cap, outbound SMS fees, payment processing pass-through fees, and similar usage-based costs are non-refundable once incurred."
   - "These reflect actual usage and third-party costs already accrued."

5. Taxes and Regulatory Fees  
   - "Any required taxes, surcharges, or regulatory fees (for example, a 4% tax/VAT-style line if applicable) are passed through and are non-refundable unless we collected them in error."

6. SLA Credits  
   - "If we fail to meet our uptime target under the SLA (/legal/sla) for a given calendar month, eligible paid accounts may request a service credit. Credits apply only to future invoices, are not cash refunds, and are the exclusive remedy for SLA-related downtime."

7. Chargebacks / Disputes  
   - "Contact us first at info@bimscorp.com with subject 'Billing Review Request' so we can investigate. If you initiate a chargeback with your bank or card issuer before giving us a reasonable opportunity to resolve it, we may suspend or terminate the affected account until the dispute is resolved."

8. How to Request Review  
   - "If you believe you qualify for a credit or billing correction, email info@bimscorp.com with:"
     - Company name
     - Plan name
     - Invoice ID
     - Explanation
   - "We will investigate in good faith. If a correction is appropriate, we will apply a credit to your next invoice or issue an adjusted invoice."

9. Changes  
   - "We may update this Refund Policy. We will post a new 'Last Updated' date. Continued use after an update means you accept the revised Refund Policy."

5. CTA BAND
After the last section, include the same CTA card pattern again, but with this headline/subtext:

Headline:
"Seat-free pricing. No surprise seat fees."

Subtext:
"Choose your job cap, not your headcount. Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."

Buttons:
- "Start Free" (blue #0B5FFF)
- <Link href="/pricing">View Pricing</Link> (white outline)

Then include the same compliance line (text-[11px] text-white/60) that links to /legal/terms and /legal/privacy with focus-visible ring classes.

6. ACCESSIBILITY
- Only one <h1> on this page.
- Every subsequent section title is <h2>.
- All <Link> and <button> use focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded.
```

## How you move from here

1. Give Prompt 1 to Replit. That updates footer, global CTAs, and prepares routes.
2. Then Prompt 2, 3, 4, 5 in that order. Each one creates the actual pages with Helmet, Wouter `<Link>`, Tailwind classes, and full copy.

After that:

* Your footer links are live.
* Your compliance language is live.
* Each legal page is its own standalone conversion funnel (Start Free / View Pricing).
* Every legal page and every CTA in the app now points to Terms + Privacy, which matters for liability, SMS consent, and ad platform approval.

You’ll be legally covered in structure, SEO-covered in metadata, conversion-covered in CTAs, and AI-search-friendly because each page is semantically labeled, internally linked, and machine-readable.
