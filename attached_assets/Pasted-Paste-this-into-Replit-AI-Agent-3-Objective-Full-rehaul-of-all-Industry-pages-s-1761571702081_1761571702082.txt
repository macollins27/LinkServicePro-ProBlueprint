## Global rules

* Mobile-first at 375px. No horizontal scroll. Tap targets ≥44px.
* Sharp corners, high contrast (AA), bold rectangular buttons.
* Each section begins with **Title + Subtitle** at top-left.
* Sticky bottom CTA on every page. Inline lead form above the fold.
* One **authentic AI-generated image per page** (see Image spec). Reuse as hero, subtle backdrop, and 1:1 thumb.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Lazy-load all non-hero media.

## Page template (for every Industry page)

Use this exact section order and structure:

1. **Hero band**

   * Title: “{Industry} Software”
   * Subtitle: 1-line benefit tailored to trade.
   * KPI tiles (3): outcome metrics relevant to the trade (placeholders OK).
   * Primary CTA: **Start Free**. Secondary: **View Pricing**.
   * Single hero image (AI-generated).

2. **What it does for {Industry}**

   * 3 bullets, each **action → outcome** in plain language.

3. **Jobs you can run**

   * 6–9 chips listing common job types for the trade.

4. **Why teams switch (Pain → Solve)**

   * Two cards. Left: 3–5 pains. Right: 3–5 solves tied to our product.

5. **How it works for {Industry} (3 steps)**

   * Step 1: Intake/Quote
   * Step 2: Schedule/Dispatch
   * Step 3: Do the work → Invoice/Payment

6. **In the field (testimonial)**

   * One quote with name + role. Portrait crops welcomed from hero if available.

7. **Features {Industry} uses most**

   * 6 feature cards linking to Feature pages. Use the site’s new card style.

8. **Integrations**

   * Chips (QuickBooks, Xero, PropertyLinkWare, LinkInspectPro, SMS/Email).

9. **Mini demo + lead capture**

   * Left: “See it in 60 seconds” poster (reuse hero as blurred overlay).
   * Right: Lead form (“See it with your jobs.” email + company). One-line success.

10. **FAQ for {Industry}**

* 5–6 Q&As. Short, direct, de-jargonized.

11. **Bottom CTA band**

* “Ready to try it?” + buttons.

* Canonical, OG tags, Twitter tags.
* JSON-LD:

  * `SoftwareApplication` with `applicationCategory: "BusinessApplication"`.

## Image generation (one image per page)

**Hard constraint:** no screens, no visible UI. If a device appears, its screen is off, obscured, or out of frame.

**Style macro**
“{INDUSTRY PRO}, {ACTION}, {CONCRETE JOBSITE DETAILS}, **no screens visible**, documentary jobsite, natural light, shallow depth, moderate contrast, OSHA-safe PPE, tight crop on hands/tools/vehicle, 35mm composition, no third-party logos.”

**Output per page**

* AVIF + WebP + JPEG at **1600 / 1200 / 768 / 480** widths.
* LQIP 20px base64 blur.
* Alt text (role + task + context). Caption ≤80 chars.
* Save to `/public/images/industries/{slug}/hero.*`.
* Return a JSON manifest per page with `alt`, `caption`, `srcsets`, `lqip`.

**Placement**

* Full-bleed **hero** image.
* Subtle **blurred overlay** behind either “How it works” or “Pain → Solve”.
* Auto 1:1 thumb for “Features {Industry} uses most” card headers.

## Features to highlight per industry

Use 6 cards per page from: Drag-and-drop Scheduling, Dispatch Board + Live Map, Route Optimization, Work Orders, Quote + E-Sign, Invoicing & Batch, Online & Field Payments, Deposits/Partials, Customer Portal, Review Requests, Capacity Planning. Choose the most relevant per trade.

## FAQs (model; rewrite per industry in contractor language)

* How fast can we import our customers and jobs?
* Can crews see the day’s work without calling in?
* What happens when weather hits?
* Can we collect deposits or take payment on site?
* Does this work offline?
* How does pricing work?

---

## Implementation steps

1. Create routes `/industries/{slug}` for all listed slugs.
2. Apply the **Industry Page template** and populate with the Content map.
3. Generate **one image per page** using the **Style macro** and each page’s prompt. Export AVIF/WebP/JPEG at 1600/1200/768/480 + LQIP. Save to `/public/images/industries/{slug}/hero.*`. Return a manifest per page.
4. Wire image into Hero, reuse blurred overlay mid-page, and auto-crop 1:1 thumb for “Features {Industry} uses most.”
5. Add JSON-LD for `SoftwareApplication` + `FAQPage`. Set unique `<title>` + meta description.
6. Ensure internal links to relevant **Feature** pages.
7. QA at 375px: no horizontal scroll, keyboard access on accordion, focus rings, Lighthouse ≥90 Perf and ≥95 A11y, CLS < 0.05.
