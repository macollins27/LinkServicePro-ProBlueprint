Awesome. Here’s your next **single, surgical prompt**—purely descriptive, no code—to have Replit Agent 3 create a **unique “Customer Results” band** right after the Industries section. It’s original to LinkServicePro (not BuildOps copy), mobile-first, and obsessively detailed so the agent can write and research its own code.

---

**Task:** Add a new homepage section titled **“Customer Results”** directly **after the Industries band** and before any pricing/resources. This band highlights real outcomes (speed, revenue, accuracy) with a small proof grid, one featured testimonial (video or quote), optional badges, and a “See more stories” CTA. Do **not** change header, hero, or other sections. Keep routing and SEO intact.

### 0) Placement & scope

* Insert the new band on the homepage only, immediately below the “Industries We Serve” section you just built.
* Do not alter any other routes, providers, or Helmet configuration.
* Use existing design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, focus styles).

### 1) Section objectives (what this band must communicate)

* LinkServicePro helps crews **move faster**, **win more jobs**, **invoice same-day**, and **reduce callbacks**.
* Social proof must be **verifiable** (names/roles/companies where available), never fake.
* The layout must be **mobile-first** and **Core Web Vitals-friendly** (no layout shift, minimal JS).

### 2) Content structure (mobile-first → then desktop)

* **Section wrapper**

  * Top/bottom padding: comfortable but compact on mobile; larger on desktop.
  * Background: your existing navy canvas. Optional faint blueprint grid overlay at 4–6% opacity (non-scrolling).
* **Header block**

  * Eyebrow: “Customer Results”
  * H2: A short, original headline (e.g., “What teams achieve with LinkServicePro”).
  * One supporting sentence that summarizes outcomes in contractor language (no jargon).
* **Metrics grid (3 items)**

  * Three compact metric cards in one row on desktop, stacked on mobile:

    * Example metric categories (adjust to your actual claims):

      * “Same-day invoicing” — subline: “no paper chase”
      * “Fewer callbacks” — subline: “measurable quality”
      * “Faster scheduling” — subline: “less dispatch chaos”
  * Each card shows: bold metric value (use a realistic placeholder if you don’t have exact numbers), short label, 1-line explainer. Include a small icon (Lucide or your set).
  * The grid must degrade gracefully if one metric is missing (don’t leave holes).
* **Featured proof (left on desktop; top on mobile)**

  * Choose **one**: a short customer **video** (preferred) or a longer **quote**.
  * If video:

    * Use a lightweight embed (research and use a “lite” technique) to avoid heavy third-party iframes on initial load.
    * Show a poster image with a big play button; load the player only on interaction.
    * Provide captions (VTT) and mute by default.
  * If quote:

    * Include headshot (optional), name, role, company; 2–3 sentence quote; link to “Read the story.”
* **Badges/assurances row (optional)**

  * Small row of trust badges (e.g., “Works with Google Calendar & Apple Calendar”, “Unlimited users on paid plans”, “Secure payments”).
  * Keep them monochrome and low-contrast to avoid visual noise.
* **CTA block**

  * Primary button: “Get Started Free” (existing route).
  * Secondary link: “See more customer stories” (route to your blog/resources/help category that actually exists).

### 3) Layout requirements

* **Mobile (default)**

  * Stack order: Header → Featured proof → Metrics grid (stacked) → Badges → CTA block.
  * Keep tap targets 44px+ high; ensure no horizontal scrolling.
* **Desktop (lg+)**

  * Use a 12-column grid.

    * Left column (content): spans ~7–8 columns (header + featured proof).
    * Right column (metrics + badges + CTA): spans ~4–5 columns; make this column visually connected (same card style).
  * Inter-column gap: small to medium; avoid large voids.
  * Section max width: the same container you’ve used elsewhere.

### 4) Visual & motion spec

* **Cards**

  * Compact, rounded corners consistent with site; inside border at very low contrast (to separate from background).
  * Subtle hover on desktop only (slight raise or inner shadow). Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
* **Icons**

  * Use your existing icon library. Size modestly; don’t over-decorate.
* **Typography**

  * H2: same scale as other section headings.
  * Metric value: visually dominant but not cartoonish.
  * Labels and explainer text: readable on navy background with AA contrast.
* **Color & contrast**

  * Ensure all text meets WCAG AA against the canvas. Keep proof cards slightly lighter than the canvas to lift them.
* **Animation**

  * No continuous motion needed. Only small entrance transitions allowed and must be disabled for reduced-motion users.

### 5) Data & sources (what to pull from your project)

* Use real **names/roles/companies/quotes** that already exist in your content system; if examples are placeholders, clearly mark them for future replacement.
* For metrics:

  * If you have reliable numbers (case studies, customer quotes, internal stats), use them.
  * If you don’t, use qualitative phrasing instead of a fake number (e.g., “Same-day invoicing” instead of “100% faster”).
* For the video:

  * If you have a video asset, use that; if not, skip video and use a quote.
  * Store posters and thumbnails in your public assets with explicit width/height to prevent CLS.

### 6) Accessibility requirements

* **Semantic structure**

  * One H2 for the section. Metric items use headings or `aria-labels` so screen readers can quickly navigate.
* **Video**

  * Must be keyboard-operable. Play button has a visible focus ring.
  * Provide captions; expose transcript link if available.
* **Images**

  * Posters and headshots must have meaningful `alt` text or `alt=""` if purely decorative (decide correctly).
* **Links & buttons**

  * CTA buttons must have descriptive names; ensure primary/secondary colors have sufficient contrast.

### 7) Performance & SEO

* **Performance**

  * Lazy-load all offscreen images; decode async.
  * Use an ultra-light embed for video; load the heavy player only on demand.
  * Provide intrinsic sizes for raster images or use CSS aspect-ratio to eliminate layout shift.
* **SEO**

  * Add JSON-LD `Review` (single) only if you are quoting a real customer with attribution; do not fabricate ratings.
  * Do not add `AggregateRating` unless you have compliant, verifiable data.
  * Keep the heading hierarchy clean; no duplicate H1s.
* **Analytics (events)**

  * Track: video play, “Get Started Free” click, “See more customer stories” click.

### 8) QA checklist (what to self-verify before finishing)

* Section appears immediately after Industries; navigation and routes unchanged.
* On mobile: clear reading order, no overflow, CTAs easily tappable.
* On desktop: no large empty spaces; columns feel connected; metrics grid doesn’t overwhelm.
* Video (if used) loads only on interaction; poster shows; captions available.
* All text passes color-contrast checks; focus states visible and consistent.
* Lighthouse mobile: no CLS flags, minimal JS impact from the embed.

### 9) Deliverables (what must be produced)

* A fully implemented “Customer Results” band per the spec above, using existing tokens and patterns.
* New content entries (metrics, quote/video, badges) in your project’s data layer or constants so they’re easy to update later.
* Documentation note (inline comment or brief readme entry) explaining where to edit the metrics and proof content.

When this ships, we’ll do another micro-step: a **compact pricing preview** teaser that nudges users toward the Pricing page without duplicating it—again with a descriptive, no-code prompt.
