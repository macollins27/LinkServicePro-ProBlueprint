Awesome—here’s clean, plug-and-play copy for the **“Why Teams Switch to LinkServicePro”** section. First are the **core cards** (competitor-agnostic), then **industry-specific variants** you can rotate in or A/B.

# Section header

* **Eyebrow:** Why Teams Switch
* **H2:** Trade chaos for one clean flow
* **Support line:** Dispatch, quotes, invoices, and maintenance—finally living in the same place so crews move faster and cash lands sooner.

# Core “Breakup Stories” cards (3–5 options)

## 1) Spreadsheet Workarounds

* **Before**

  * Typing the same details three times in three tabs
  * Job status lives in someone’s head, not on the screen
* **After with LinkServicePro**

  * One job record feeds scheduling → quote → invoice
  * Live crew status without asking the group chat
* **Proof hint:** Same-day invoicing becomes the default, not the exception.
* **CTA:** See how we replace spreadsheets → `/solutions/spreadsheets`

## 2) Legacy Desktop System

* **Before**

  * Tied to the office PC; field photos arrive days later
  * Updates require IT, not dispatch
* **After with LinkServicePro**

  * Field app pushes photos, notes, and signatures in real time
  * Updates ship quietly without downtime
* **Proof hint:** Office hears “job done” the moment the tech wraps up.
* **CTA:** See modern field ops → `/solutions/legacy`

## 3) 4-App Patchwork

* **Before**

  * Logins everywhere; exports and imports between apps
  * Quotes and invoices start from scratch every time
* **After with LinkServicePro**

  * One login, one flow, no retyping
  * Quotes convert to invoices in a click
* **Proof hint:** Handoffs become seconds, not hours.
* **CTA:** Simplify your stack → `/solutions/patchwork`

## 4) Email & Text Chaos (optional)

* **Before**

  * Work orders buried in threads; lost photos, missed notes
  * “Did anyone invoice that?” (silence)
* **After with LinkServicePro**

  * Jobs tracked end-to-end with required fields
  * Nothing leaves the day without an invoice
* **Proof hint:** Callback rate drops because details don’t slip.
* **CTA:** Bring jobs out of the inbox → `/solutions/email-text`

## 5) Paper Trails (optional)

* **Before**

  * Crumpled time sheets and missing signatures
  * Month-end billing panic
* **After with LinkServicePro**

  * Digital time, parts, and signatures—captured on site
  * Invoices fly the same day
* **Proof hint:** Collections speed up when invoices go out on time.
* **CTA:** Ditch paper for good → `/solutions/paper`

# Industry-specific switch variants

Use one per industry (or rotate). Keep the structure: **Title → Before → After → Proof hint → CTA**.

## HVAC

* **Title:** HVAC crews leaving spreadsheets behind

  * Seasonal PMs scheduled and visible at a glance
  * Photos, pressures, and notes sync from the roof in real time

## Electrical

* **Title:** Electrical teams replacing the 4-app patchwork

## Plumbing

* **Title:** Plumbing shops moving off legacy desktops

## Construction/GC Service
