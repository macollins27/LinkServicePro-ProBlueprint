Heard. Let’s make pricing simple and conversion-forward. Here’s a single, surgical, no-code prompt to rebuild a mobile-first Pricing section that’s crystal clear, uses an attached email field + button, and fits your global container. It replaces any pricing content currently on the homepage.

⸻

Task

Replace the current pricing area with a mobile-first Pricing band that communicates job-based pricing and unlimited users, offers three sensible presets by job volume, and captures leads via an email input with the button attached on the right. No tooltips, no portals.

Placement & scope
	•	Lives after Quick Start and before Blog/Resources.
	•	Update only this section and its data/config. Do not change routes, header, or other sections.

Objectives (what this section must communicate)
	•	Pricing is job-based (not per seat).
	•	Unlimited users on paid plans.
	•	Three presets so buyers self-identify quickly.
	•	Primary conversion: Get Started Free via attached email CTA; Secondary: Talk to an expert.

⸻

Structure (mobile → desktop)
	1.	Header (left-aligned, inside global container)
	•	Eyebrow: Pricing (keep eyebrow style; not blue)
	•	H2: Job-based pricing, unlimited users
	•	Support: Add as many people as you need—pricing scales with the work, not headcount.
	2.	Job-volume presets (radio pills)
	•	Three pills: Small Team (~0–50 jobs / month), Growing Ops (~51–200 jobs / month), Multi-Crew (200+ jobs / month).
	•	Acts as a radiogroup with aria-selected, keyboard Left/Right/Home/End.
	•	Selecting a pill updates the “Best for …” text on tier cards (no price math on page).
	3.	Tier cards (3, equal height)
	•	Titles: Starter, Growth, Pro.
	•	Top chip on every card: Unlimited users.
	•	“Best for …” line reflects the selected preset.
	•	Bullets (max 5 each):
	•	Starter: Projects & work orders, Quotes & invoices, Mobile field app, Basic reporting, Email support
	•	Growth: Everything in Starter, Employee labor & payroll, GPS-verified timesheets, Property Linkware integration, Priority support
	•	Pro: Everything in Growth, Advanced project roll-ups, Custom workflows, API access, SLA support
	•	Small Select plan button on each card scroll-focuses the form below and sets a hidden { selected_plan }.
	4.	Pricing facts strip (one line, low contrast)
	•	Unlimited users on paid plans • Cancel anytime • No credit card required to start
	5.	Email lead form (attached control) — primary CTA
	•	One input + attached button (shared border radius; no gap).
	•	Placeholder: Enter your email
	•	Button text: Get Started Free →
	•	Validation on submit (reasonable regex); inline error under field; success message: You’re in—check your email to get started.
	•	Submit to existing handler or stub POST /api/lead with { email, source: "home_pricing", selected_volume, selected_plan }.
	•	Under form: muted xs legal line By continuing you agree to our Terms and acknowledge our Privacy Policy.
	•	Tiny secondary link: Talk to an expert → existing contact/demo route.
	6.	FAQ teaser (single line)
	•	Questions on billing or migrations? See our Pricing FAQ → (link to your FAQ route).

⸻

Visual & motion
	•	Use existing tokens (navy canvas, rounded-xl, subtle inner borders).
	•	Cards: equal heights, compact padding; no Masonry.
	•	Motion limited to pill selection/hover and form focus; respect prefers-reduced-motion. No carousels, no auto-animation.

⸻

Accessibility
	•	One h2 for the section; card titles are h3.
	•	Radio pills: role="radiogroup" + each pill role="radio", aria-checked, keyboard Left/Right/Home/End.
	•	Email input has a visible or sr-only label; type="email", autocomplete="email".
	•	Error/success tied via aria-describedby; messages announced with aria-live="polite".
	•	Buttons/links ≥44px; visible focus rings.

⸻

Performance
	•	No tooltips, no portals, no third-party embeds.
	•	Zero CLS: fixed paddings, consistent card heights, intrinsic sizes for any icons/images (if used).
