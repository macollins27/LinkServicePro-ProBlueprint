Got it—here’s a **single, surgical, no-code prompt** you can paste into Replit Agent 3 to normalize the section styling and fix the matrix UX issues you flagged. No code; let the agent implement with your existing design system.

---

**Task:** Bring the “Why Teams Switch” comparison matrix in line with the site’s global section styles and improve readability/UX. Do not change other sections or routes.

### 1) Section header & alignment (match global pattern)

* **Alignment:** Left-align the entire section header block (eyebrow, H2, subtitle) to match the rest of the homepage.
* **Copy (exact):**

  * Eyebrow: `WHY TEAMS SWITCH`
  * **H2:** `Why Teams Switch`
  * **Subtitle (support line):** `See it in one table.`
  * Body/support sentence (keep below subtitle, left-aligned): `Projects with real dollars, hours, assets, and conversations—kept in one place so work flows and cash lands sooner.`
* **Color/weights:** Use the same color token and typography scale used for other sections:

  * Eyebrow: muted/uppercase tracking (same token as the others).
  * H2: standard section heading color (not blue).
  * Subtitle: same muted/support color as elsewhere (remove blue).
* Spacing: top/bottom paddings and header→content spacing must match the global section rhythm.

### 2) Table row order & first-column width

* **Row order (top to bottom):**

  1. `LinkServicePro`
  2. `Other FSM software (generic)`  ← **move to be second row**
  3. `Spreadsheets (Excel/Sheets)`
  4. `Legacy Desktop System`
  5. `4-App Patchwork`
* **First column width:** Increase the **row-title column** so names don’t truncate or wrap awkwardly.

  * Desktop: allocate a wider min width (e.g., ~22–26% of the table or a fixed min-width that prevents squish).
  * Mobile: keep the first column **sticky** and readable; ensure at least 14–16ch of space before truncation with ellipsis.

### 3) Legend + tooltips for states (✓ / – / ✕)

* Add a **small legend** directly above the table (right side on desktop; full-width row on mobile). Text only—no extra chrome:

  * `✓ Included` (green) `– Partial / workaround` (amber) `✕ Missing` (red)
* Add an **info tooltip** to the amber hyphen **in the legend and in every amber cell**:

  * Tooltip copy: `Partial or requires workarounds. Some steps may be manual or split across tools.`
* Ensure every table cell state (✓ / – / ✕) includes **sr-only text**: “Included”, “Partial”, or “Missing”.

### 4) Column header clarity

* Keep the 8 capability columns as currently defined. For each column header:

  * Left-align header labels.
  * Add a subtle info icon with a one-line tooltip (existing meanings).
  * Ensure header row stays **sticky** when horizontally scrolling on mobile.

### 5) Mobile usability

* Maintain horizontal scroll with gradient fades at the container edges.
* Provide the existing **column picker** control; default it to the most important 4 columns on small screens so the table is immediately readable.
* Ensure the first column (solution names) remains sticky and readable while scrolling horizontally.

### 6) Buttons beneath the table (visibility & hierarchy)

* Two CTAs must be visible, left-aligned under the table with proper spacing:

  * **Primary:** `Get Started Free`
  * **Secondary:** `Talk to an expert`
* Fix the overflow/contrast so the secondary button is fully visible and readable on all breakpoints (no clipping, adequate contrast).
* Maintain existing analytics events on both CTAs.

### 7) A11y & performance

* Semantic table with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th scope="col">`, `<th scope="row">`.
* Tooltip triggers are keyboard focusable; ESC closes.
* No layout shift: fixed column widths; intrinsic icon sizes.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (remove any scroll-snap/animations if present).

### 8) Acceptance checklist (verify before finishing)

* Section header is **left-aligned** and uses the same color/scale as all other sections; subtitle is **not blue**.
* H2 reads “**Why Teams Switch**”; subtitle reads “**See it in one table.**”
* Row order: LSP → Other FSM → Spreadsheets → Legacy Desktop → 4-App Patchwork.
* First column is wide enough that row names are **clearly readable** on desktop and mobile.
* Legend present with ✓ / – / ✕; amber hyphen has the specified tooltip everywhere.
* Both CTAs render side-by-side (or stacked on small screens) with proper contrast and no clipping.
* Sticky header and sticky first column work during horizontal scroll; column picker defaults to 4 visible columns on mobile.
* All a11y requirements pass (sr-only labels for states, focus rings visible, tooltips accessible).

Run exactly these changes and keep the rest of the matrix content as is. After that, we can fine-tune column copy or add a tiny “What this means” expander under the generic rows if you want even clearer context.
