PROMPT: “Create professional industry landing pages (single template + data)”

Do not rebuild the app. Keep routing and hero. Implement a dynamic industry page template and data. Mobile-first. No new libraries.

Files and structure

Pages:

Use the existing router. Add a route for /industries/:slug that renders a new template component.

New components in client/src/sections/industries/:

IndustryHero.tsx

IndustryOutcomes.tsx

IndustryWorkflowTabs.tsx

IndustryPainSolution.tsx

IndustryFeatureGrid.tsx

IndustryCalendarsBand.tsx

IndustryPricingTeaser.tsx

IndustryTestimonial.tsx

IndustryFAQ.tsx

IndustryResources.tsx

IndustryFinalCTA.tsx

New page template:

client/src/pages/industries/[slug].tsx or your project’s route convention file that reads the URL param and renders the sections above using industry data.

Data

Create client/src/data/industries-details.ts:

export type IndustryDetail = {
  slug: string;               // must match existing industry slug
  name: string;               // e.g., "Plumbing"
  icon: string;               // lucide icon name, fallback "Wrench"
  hero: {
    subhead: string;          // one sentence
  };
  pains: {pain: string; fix: string;}[];   // 4–6 items
  features: {
    label: string;
    minPlan: "Free"|"Starter"|"Essential"|"Premium"|"Platinum";
    blurb?: string;
  }[];
  faq: {q: string; a: string;}[];          // 5 items
  testimonial?: {
    quote: string;
    author: string;
    role?: string;
  };
  typicalJobs: number[];      // e.g., [25, 75, 150, 350, 600]
};
export const INDUSTRY_DETAILS: IndustryDetail[] = [
  {
    slug: "plumbing",
    name: "Plumbing",
    icon: "Wrench",
    hero: { subhead: "Book jobs, route techs, send estimates with e-sign, take deposits, and keep customers in the loop." },
    pains: [
      { pain: "After-hours leaks flood your board", fix: "Drag-and-drop dispatch with color codes and priorities" },
      { pain: "Paper estimates get ignored", fix: "1-tap e-sign on mobile and auto follow-ups" },
      { pain: "Parts and labor aren’t tracked", fix: "Line-item estimates and invoice conversions" },
      { pain: "No-shows waste routes", fix: "Automated reminders via SMS/email" },
    ],
    features: [
      { label: "Drag-and-drop scheduling (calendar sync)", minPlan: "Free" },
      { label: "Work orders, photos, files", minPlan: "Free" },
      { label: "Estimates & digital signatures", minPlan: "Free" },
      { label: "Two-way messaging + reminders", minPlan: "Starter" },
      { label: "Recurring jobs & maintenance plans", minPlan: "Essential" },
      { label: "Route optimization + GPS", minPlan: "Essential" },
      { label: "Project tracking & job costing", minPlan: "Premium" },
      { label: "Advanced reporting & automations", minPlan: "Premium" },
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: "Can I sync tech schedules to Google/Apple Calendar?", a: "Yes. Two-way calendar sync keeps crews aligned without extra steps." },
      { q: "Do I need separate accounts for each tech?", a: "No. All paid plans include unlimited users." },
      { q: "How do quotes become invoices?", a: "Convert with one tap, collect deposits, and accept partial payments." },
      { q: "Can I set recurring maintenance visits?", a: "Yes. Essential and above support recurring jobs and plans." },
      { q: "Do customers get a portal?", a: "Yes. Customers can view quotes, invoices, and pay online." },
    ],
    testimonial: { quote: "We cut no-shows by a third and got paid within a day.", author: "Jordan M.", role: "Owner, Clearwater Plumbing" },
    typicalJobs: [25, 75, 150, 350, 600],
  },
  // Add entries for the rest of your slugs; copy and adjust nouns only.
];


If a detail entry for a slug is missing, the page should still render with sensible defaults pulled from client/src/data/industries.ts.

Template composition (exact order)

Render these sections in [slug].tsx:

IndustryHero

H1: “{name} software to schedule, dispatch, and get paid.”

Subhead from data.

CTA buttons: Primary “Start Free”, Secondary “Talk to sales”.

Trust pills: Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Unlimited users, Job-based pricing.

Right: gray image placeholder (role="img" with alt="${name} app preview placeholder").

IndustryOutcomes

Three compact cards with icons: “Fewer no-shows”, “Faster approvals”, “Paid within 24 hrs”.

IndustryWorkflowTabs

Tabs as defined in the blueprint. Keyboard accessible. Each tab includes a 1000×640 gray image and 3 bullets.

IndustryPainSolution

2×2 or 2×3 grid of {pain → fix} cards pulled from pains.

IndustryFeatureGrid

Up to 8 feature cards with minimum plan badges using your existing plan tokens.

IndustryCalendarsBand

Small band with Google/Apple badges and 1-sentence copy.

IndustryPricingTeaser

Inline selector for typicalJobs.

Compute the recommended plan using helpers from client/src/data/plans.ts (use planForJobs or implement if missing).

Show plan tile with price, job cap, and buttons: “Open pricing calculator” and “See full pricing”.

IndustryTestimonial

If testimonial exists in data, render the quote card with placeholder video modal. If not, hide section.

IndustryFAQ

5 accordion items from data. Also output FAQ JSON-LD schema.

IndustryResources

3 tiles with links to templates, walkthrough, and help center.

IndustryFinalCTA

Dark band with “No credit card to start • Import jobs via CSV • Cancel anytime” and inline email + TCPA checkbox.

Styling constraints

Use existing color tokens and rounded-2xl cards.

Hover = mild lift and shadow, no gradients.

Visible focus rings.

Gray image placeholders must reserve space to avoid CLS (aspect-[5/3] or fixed min-height).

All controls have aria-labels. Tabs and dialogs keyboard accessible.

SEO & schema

In [slug].tsx set:

<title>: “{name} Field Service Software | Link Service Pro”

<meta name="description"> from blueprint sentence with {name} swapped.

Emit JSON-LD:

BreadcrumbList (Home → Industries → {name})

SoftwareApplication (generic)

FAQPage with the five FAQs

Analytics events (data attributes)

data-analytics="industry_start_free_click:{slug}"

data-analytics="industry_pricing_teaser_open_calculator:{slug}"

data-analytics="industry_tab_view:{slug}:{tab}"

Acceptance criteria

Visiting /industries/plumbing renders all sections above with the plumbing data.

If a slug lacks a detail record, page renders with defaults (name from industries.ts, generic hero subhead, default pains/faq).

Tabs, accordions, and modal are keyboard accessible.

Lighthouse mobile on an industry page: performance ≥ 90, accessibility ≥ 95, SEO ≥ 90.

No mention of accounting integrations; calendar integrations shown.

No TypeScript errors.

Do not modify the homepage hero or hero carousel. Build only the industry page template, sections, and data.
