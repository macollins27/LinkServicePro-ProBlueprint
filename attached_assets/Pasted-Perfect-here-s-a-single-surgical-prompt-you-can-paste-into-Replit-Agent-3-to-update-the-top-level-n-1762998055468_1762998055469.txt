Perfect—here’s a single, surgical prompt you can paste into Replit Agent 3 to update the top-level navbar item hover so it matches the look of your mega-menu cards (blue outline + subtle inner shadow), without touching routing, copy, or other sections.

⸻

Task: Update the top-level navbar item hover state (e.g., Features, Industries, Pricing, Resources) to use a LinkServicePro-styled blue outline and a subtle inner shadow, inspired by the mega-menu item hover. Replace the current hover underline with this treatment. Keep focus rings, keyboard behavior, and mega-menu accessibility intact. Use the existing design system tokens and utilities.  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼

Scope
	•	Only edit the desktop + mobile Navbar component (top-level items + their triggers).
	•	Do not change routes, Helmet, layout, or menu content. Keep all ARIA and keyboard interactions as implemented.  ￼  ￼

Targets
	•	File: client/src/components/Navbar.tsx (or wherever the primary nav links/triggers live).
	•	Apply the new hover treatment to:
	•	Top-level nav links/buttons that open mega menus.
	•	Top-level non-menu links (e.g., Pricing).
	•	The existing mega-menu hover look is the reference for tone (outline + subtle elevation), not exact pixels.  ￼

Visual spec (use your existing tokens/utilities)
	•	Color: brand blue for the outline (#0B5FFF).  ￼
	•	Outline/Border: visible 1px “blue” outline on hover. There must be no layout shift—use techniques that don’t change element width on hover (e.g., maintain a transparent border at rest or use an inset shadow).
	•	Inner shadow: very subtle inset shadow/elevation to echo the mega-menu item feel (no heavy drop shadows). Keep it crisp against the dark header.
	•	Shape: keep your nav item shape consistent with the design system (minimal rounding, tool-grade aesthetic).  ￼
	•	Focus state: preserve the existing focus ring style (ring-2 brand blue with ring-offset) so keyboard users get the same experience. Hover must not suppress focus ring.  ￼
	•	Remove underline on hover: the old blue underline should not appear on hover. If you need a persistent active route marker, keep your current active style unchanged—this request is hover only.

Behavior & a11y
	•	Hover/press states must not interfere with the mega-menu open/close logic, click-outside, or Escape-to-close. Keep current ARIA and keyboard navigation exactly as documented.  ￼
	•	Maintain 44px+ hit target and consistent spacing so nothing “jumps” when hovering.
	•	Respect prefers-reduced-motion (no animated shadows/outlines).  ￼

Acceptance criteria
	1.	On desktop, hovering Features/Industries/Pricing/Resources shows a blue 1px outline and subtle inner shadow with no layout shift; the old underline does not appear.
	2.	Keyboard focus still shows the focus ring (brand blue, offset) and is not overridden by hover.  ￼
	3.	Mega-menu accessibility remains intact: triggers announce expanded state, Escape closes, focus is trapped appropriately when open.  ￼
	4.	Mobile/touch: press states look consistent (outline/inner shadow) and do not collide with the mobile menu styling.
	5.	No changes to routes, titles, SEO, or other sections of the site.

Implementation notes (guidance, not code)
	•	Use the same utility system you’re already using (Tailwind/shadcn) for borders, ring, and shadow; apply them to the nav item wrapper so the effect looks like a pill/lozenge around the label.  ￼
	•	To avoid layout shift, keep a baseline transparent border (or equivalent) at rest and only change color/elevation on hover.
	•	Ensure the new hover style is consistent across both link and button triggers in the Navbar.

Run just this change and keep everything else untouched. Once it’s live, we can tune the intensity and spacing to taste and then move on to the next refinement.
