## Objective

Replace `/industries` with a **wow-factor, mobile-first Industries hub** that matches the new Home + Features aesthetic and converts. High contrast, sharp rectangles, thick type, underline-on-hover drawn **right→left**, subtle depth, fast.

Do it now.

## Visual + UX Guardrails

* Mobile-first at **375px**. No horizontal scroll. Tap targets ≥44px.
* Sticky bottom CTA across the page. Inline lead form above the fold.
* Every section begins **top-left** with **Title + Subtitle**.
* Rectangular buttons, bold labels. Primary = brand blue, Secondary = neutral.
* Shadows: `.elev-2` cards, `.elev-3` hero CTA bar.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; reduce transform durations to 100–150ms.
* Image policy: **documentary jobsite, no screens/UI visible**. Diverse crews, OSHA-safe.

## Page Structure (exact order)

1. **Hero band — “Industry Solutions”**
   Subtitle: “Purpose-built workflows for every trade—scheduling, dispatch, and payments in one place.”
   KPI chips (3): `+24% Win rate` · `−18% Drive time` · `+37% Same-day pay`
   Primary CTA **Start Free** · Secondary **View Pricing**
   **Hero visual:** Mosaic **vertical carousel** (auto + swipe) of 4–6 jobsite photos (AI-generated, prompts below). Mosaic style matches homepage hero; subtle mesh gradient background.

2. **Find your trade (search + cluster filters)**
   Real-time search filters cards. Cluster pills: **Exterior & Grounds**, **Home & Building Services**, **Mechanical & Electrical**, **All** default. Active pill = bold + 2px bottom bar. Announce results count for a11y.

3. **Industries grid (cards)**
   Mobile 1-col, ≥768px 2-col, ≥1024px 3-col.
   Card content:

   * Name
   * One-line hook
   * 3 short benefits (bullets)
   * **CTA:** “See {Industry} page →”
   * Mini pictogram badge (AI icon) and **micro photo** (auto-crop from hero set)
     Hover: slight lift + shadow; underline animates right→left.

4. **What you get (platform value)**
   6 feature icon cards linking to Features: Scheduling; Dispatch + Live Map; Route Optimization; Work Orders; Quote + E-Sign; Invoicing & Payments. Copy pattern **action → outcome** (≤10 words).

5. **How it works for any trade (3 steps)**
   Step cards with connecting progress line.

   1. Intake & Quote → *Capture requests and build estimates.*
   2. Schedule & Dispatch → *Drag-drop jobs and assign crews.*
   3. Do the work & Get paid → *Photo proof, invoice, tap-to-pay.*
      **Backdrop:** use a blurred, darkened overlay of a hero photo behind this band.

6. **Results you can feel in 30 days (proof band)**
   3 metric tiles with mini sparklines; below them 3 micro case-study chips (trade, crew size, short outcome).

7. **Proof from the field (testimonials gallery)**
   3 jobsite portraits (not studio), name + role + one crisp sentence. Star row optional.

8. **Mini demo + lead capture**
   Left: poster with 3 bullets of what the demo shows. Right: compact **email + company** lead form titled “See it with your jobs.” One-line success: “Got it — we’ll reach out within one business day.”

9. **FAQ (accordion, 5 items)**
   Short, contractor language. Keyboard accessible. Add FAQPage JSON-LD.

10. **Bottom CTA band**
    Headline: “Ready to try it?” · Buttons: **View Pricing** and **Start Free**.

11. **Sticky bottom CTA**
    Always visible on scroll. Same buttons.

## AI Images (unlimited; generate as needed)

**Style macro (apply to all):**
“Documentary jobsite, natural light, shallow depth, moderate contrast, OSHA-safe PPE, diverse crews, **no screens or UI visible**, 35mm composition, no third-party logos.”

**Hero carousel (generate 6):**

1. **HVAC** — Tech checking pressures on rooftop condenser with analog gauge set; cityline blur.
2. **Plumbing** — Tightening compression fitting under sink; bucket, rags, valve.
3. **Landscaping** — Crew loading mulch forks from trailer; printed job tickets on clipboards.
4. **Cleaning/Janitorial** — Crew leader taping checklist to cart in office hallway at night.
5. **Roofing** — Roofer placing shingle bundle with harness and anchor at dawn.
6. **Electrical** — Electrician torquing a panel lug with insulated driver; label tape nearby.

**Micro photos for cards (auto-crop 1:1):**
Use industry-specific shots: hose reel & surface cleaner (Pressure Washing); extension pole squeegee (Window Cleaning); mower deck & trimmer line (Lawn Care); snow plow pin lock (Snow Removal); paint tape on trim (Painting); etc.

**Icon pictograms:**
Generate simple line icons (no text) for each trade badge; monochrome slate on light card.

Export each photo as **AVIF/WebP/JPEG** at 1600/1200/768/480 + **LQIP 20px blur**. Save under `/public/images/industries/index/{slug}-{n}.*`. Provide a manifest (alt + caption + srcsets) and wire images into hero carousel + cards.
