Understood. Replace the current industry section with a **tight, fluid carousel** that shows **8 cards per view on desktop**, never dumps 40 cards down the page, and fixes text clipping.

## PROMPT: “Industry carousel v2 — 8-per-view desktop, fluid slider, no overflow”

**Scope**

* Only modify the industry section. Do not touch hero or other sections.
* Replace `IndustryCarouselPro.tsx` with `IndustryCarouselV2.tsx` and update `home.tsx` to import the new component.
* Keep the same `industries.ts` data array, but **render inside a paged carousel**, not as a wall of cards.

**Layout & behavior**

* Section padding: `py-12 sm:py-16`, container `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`.
* Heading centered: “Built for Your Trade” + “Workflows tailored to your industry”.
* **Carousel track** uses **CSS scroll-snap** + inertial scrolling. No new libraries.
* **Cards-per-view** by breakpoint (exact):

  * `base`: **2.2** per view (min-w ~ 46%)
  * `sm`: **3.2** per view (min-w ~ 31%)
  * `md`: **4.2** per view (min-w ~ 24%)
  * `lg`: **6** per view (min-w ~ 16.5%)
  * `xl+`: **8** per view (min-w ~ 12.5%)
* The track loops seamlessly by **cloning first N items** to the end and last N to the start (N = cards-per-view at current breakpoint). When scroll reaches clones, jump scrollLeft to the real set (no flicker).
* **Prev/Next** buttons (`md+` only) scroll by **exact viewport group** width (cards-per-view × card width).
* **Pagination dots** below track on mobile. Active dot based on current group index.

**Card spec (fix formatting)**

* Wrapper: `relative group` with gradient ring on hover/focus only.
* **Fixed, equal height**: `h-40 sm:h-44` with inner flex column.
* **Icon**: centered, `text-3xl sm:text-4xl`, do not overflow.
* **Title**: use `text-[clamp(0.9rem,2vw,1rem)] font-medium leading-tight line-clamp-1` (no wrapping beyond one line).
* **Subline**: `text-slate-500 text-xs line-clamp-1` (no overflow).
* Use `truncate/line-clamp` utilities to prevent cut off. Never wrap to 2+ lines.
* Inner padding: `p-3 sm:p-4`.
* Visual:

  * Card base: `bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-sm`
  * Gradient ring on hover/focus only: pseudo `before:` with `p-[2px] bg-gradient-to-r from-[#0B5FFF] via-[#0FB36F] to-[#0B5FFF] opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 focus-within:opacity-100 transition-opacity rounded-2xl`
  * Elevation on hover: `shadow-md` + micro `scale-[1.015]` via `transition-transform`.
* Entire card is a link: `<Link to={`/industries/${slug}`}>` with `aria-label="View [name] workflows"` and visible focus ring: `ring-2 ring-[#0B5FFF] ring-offset-2`.

**Track implementation**

* Track element:

  ```tsx
  <div
    id="industry-track"
    className="relative -mx-4 px-4 overflow-x-auto no-scrollbar snap-x snap-mandatory scroll-smooth"
    aria-roledescription="carousel"
    aria-label="Industries"
  >
    <ul className="flex gap-3 sm:gap-4 items-stretch">
      {/* cloned tail N */}
      {/* real items */}
      {/* cloned head N */}
    </ul>
  </div>
  ```
* Each `<li>` has `className="snap-start min-w-[calc(100%/2.2)] sm:min-w-[calc(100%/3.2)] md:min-w-[calc(100%/4.2)] lg:min-w-[calc(100%/6)] xl:min-w-[calc(100%/8)]"` so exactly the counts above appear.
* Keep track state: `cardsPerView` from a resize listener that maps current breakpoint to 2.2/3.2/4.2/6/8.
* Clone N items before & after. On scroll end, if scrolled into clone region, immediately reset `scrollLeft` to the matching real index.

**Controls**

* Prev/Next buttons (`md:block`, `hidden` below md):

  * Absolutely centered vertically, outside edges of container.
  * Styles: `rounded-full bg-white/80 backdrop-blur ring-1 ring-slate-200 shadow hover:bg-white` with icon chevrons.
  * On click: `track.scrollBy({left: groupWidth * (prev ? -1 : 1), behavior: 'smooth'})`, where `groupWidth = track.clientWidth`.
* Keyboard:

  * Left/Right arrows on the track do the same `scrollBy`.
* Pagination dots (`base` only):

  * Dot count = `ceil(totalRealCards / cardsPerView)`.
  * Click moves to that group (compute left by index * groupWidth).

**A11y**

* Buttons: `aria-label="Previous industries"` and `aria-label="Next industries"`, `aria-controls="industry-track"`.
* Each dot: `aria-label="Go to group N"`, `aria-current` on active.
* Ensure focus is not trapped; tabbing moves through cards.

**Data**

* Reuse `industries.ts` but you may shorten subline to a single generic text for all (e.g., “Estimate → Schedule → Invoice”).
* Icons: map unknown icons to `Wrench`.

**Section height discipline**

* Limit vertical footprint:

  * Heading block + 1 line subtext.
  * Carousel track height governed by card `h-40 sm:h-44`.
  * Buttons and dots compact; **do not** exceed ~520px total section height on desktop.

**CSS fixes to stop text cut-off**

* Add `line-clamp-1` and `truncate` on title and subline.
* Use `leading-tight` and clamp font sizing.
* Prevent overflow on icon and container: `overflow-hidden` only inside the card body; **not** on the track wrapper.

**Acceptance**

* Desktop shows exactly 8 cards per view at `xl+`, 6 at `lg`, 4.2 at `md`, 3.2 at `sm`, 2.2 at base.
* Smooth, continuous loop with Prev/Next and dots working.
* No card text clipping at any width.
* Section height compact. No giant wall of cards.
* Mobile-first performance and a11y preserved.

**Don’ts**

* No new libraries.
* Don’t change other sections.
* Don’t increase card text to 2+ lines.
* Don’t set fixed pixel widths; use the min-w calculations above.
