Got it. Here’s a **single, surgical, no-code prompt** to replace the current “Why Teams Switch to LinkServicePro” with a new, competitor-oriented design that avoids tabs and avoids feature comparison tables.

---

**Task:** Redesign the “Why Teams Switch to LinkServicePro” homepage band to be **competitor-oriented** without tabs and without a matrix/table. The new section should communicate real switching motivations, migration simplicity, and clear outcomes—original to LinkServicePro. Do not change any other sections, routes, or SEO outside this band.

### 0) Placement & scope

* Replace the existing “Why Teams Switch to LinkServicePro” section in its current position (right after Industries).
* Use existing design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, focus styles). No global refactors.

### 1) Section purpose (what it must convey)

* Teams leave **spreadsheet workflows**, **legacy desktop tools**, and **multi-app patchworks** because they cause retyping, delays, and errors.
* LinkServicePro provides a **single, cohesive flow** (Scheduling/Dispatch → Estimates/Quotes → Invoicing/Payments → Maintenance Plans) with faster cash and fewer callbacks.
* Switching is **safe and guided** (import, training, and support).

### 2) Content structure (no tabs, no tables)

**A) Header block**

* Eyebrow: “Why Teams Switch”
* H2: short, punchy headline (e.g., “Trade chaos for one clean flow.”)
* One supporting sentence in plain language, non-comparative, no competitor names or logos.

**B) “Breakup Stories” cards (3–5 cards, single row on desktop; stacked on mobile)**

* Each card follows the same narrative:

  * Title: the situation they’re leaving (e.g., “Spreadsheet Workarounds”, “Legacy Desktop System”, “4-App Patchwork”).
  * “Before” pain: 2 short bullets (retyping, late invoices, unknown job status).
  * “After” outcome with LinkServicePro: 2 short bullets (same-day invoicing, single source of truth, live crew status).
  * Micro-metric or proof hint (qualitative if exact numbers aren’t available).
  * CTA link: “See how we replace this” → a relevant feature/solutions page you already have.
* Visual: neutral, **non-brand** illustration or AI-generated metaphor (no competitor IP, no logos). Consistent style across cards.

**C) “Switch in 3 Steps” process strip (horizontal on desktop; vertical on mobile)**

* Step 1: **Import** (customers, jobs, items).
* Step 2: **Train** (dispatch + field app quickstart).
* Step 3: **Go live** (first week: scheduling + quotes + invoices).
* Each step shows a small icon and one sentence. Link to Help/Docs if available.

**D) “Assurances” row (3 compact badges)**

* Examples: “Unlimited users on paid plans”, “Calendar sync (Google & Apple)”, “Secure payments”.
* Monochrome, low-contrast badges to avoid visual noise.

**E) CTA block**

* Primary: “Get Started Free” (existing route).
* Secondary: “Talk to an expert” (existing contact/demo route).

### 3) Layout & sizing (mobile-first)

* **Mobile (default)**: Stack blocks in the order Header → Breakup Stories (cards stacked) → 3-Step strip → Assurances → CTA.
* **Desktop (lg+)**:

  * 12-column grid.
  * Header spans 8–10 columns (centered or left-aligned).
  * Breakup Stories cards in a 3–5 card row with equal widths and consistent heights (no Masonry).
  * 3-Step strip as a horizontal band below the cards.
  * Assurances row beneath, then the CTA.

### 4) Interactions & motion (subtle; no auto-tabs, no carousels)

* Card hover (desktop only): subtle lift or inner shadow; border becomes brand blue; **no layout shift** (keep a transparent border at rest).
* Optional micro-motion for the 3-Step icons on viewport entry; disable for `prefers-reduced-motion`.
* **No auto-rotate** and **no continuous motion** in this section.

### 5) Copy guidance (original, competitor-oriented but neutral)

* Avoid mentioning specific competitor brand names or copying their messaging.
* “Before” bullets describe problems generically (retyping, late invoicing, status blind spots).
* “After” bullets map to LinkServicePro outcomes you actually deliver (faster dispatch, same-day invoice, recurring plans).
* Keep it concrete and short—contractor language, not buzzwords.

### 6) Visual direction

* Canvas/background matches the site’s navy tone.
* Cards: rounded, inside border at low contrast; consistent internal padding; icons limited and purposeful.
* Illustrations or AI images are **neutral metaphors** (workflow, tools, dashboards), **not** brand marks.
* Color contrast: all text AA or better.

### 7) Accessibility

* Semantic structure: one H2 for the section; card titles as H3s.
* All interactive elements (links, CTAs) have visible focus rings and ≥44px hit targets.
* Decorative illustrations are `alt=""`; informative visuals have concise `alt`.
* No content conveyed by color alone; keep icon + text pairing.

### 8) Performance

* No third-party embeds in this section.
* Lazy-load imagery that’s below the fold; `decoding="async"`.
* Provide intrinsic dimensions or aspect ratios to eliminate layout shift.

### 9) SEO

* Clean heading hierarchy; avoid keyword stuffing.
* No Review/AggregateRating schema here (testimonials live elsewhere).
* Internal links are crawlable and point to real pages (features/solutions/help).

### 10) Analytics (events)

* Track card clicks (`why-switch.card_click` with card key).
* Track CTA clicks (`why-switch.cta_primary`, `why-switch.cta_secondary`).
* Track 3-Step help/docs clicks if present.

### 11) Acceptance criteria

1. Section renders with **no tabs** and **no comparison table/matrix**.
2. “Breakup Stories” cards clearly show **Before → After** with concise bullets and a CTA per card.
3. “Switch in 3 Steps” is obvious and readable; icons and copy are consistent.
4. Assurances are present but low-contrast; the CTA pair is visible and distinct.
5. Accessibility, contrast, and focus states pass; no layout shift; no continuous animation.
6. Routes and SEO outside this band remain unchanged.

When this ships, we can iterate on the **card copy** and add industry-specific “switch” variants (e.g., an HVAC-focused card) without ever resorting to a tabbed or table layout.
