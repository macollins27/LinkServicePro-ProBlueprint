Here’s a **single, surgical, no-code prompt** you can paste into Replit Agent 3. It fixes the width/alignment, removes duplication in the heading, unblocks tooltips, **reduces the matrix to 4 high-signal differentiators**, prunes rows, widens the first column, and centers the CTAs—down to the tiny details. No other sections or routes should change.

---

**Task:** Refactor the “Why Teams Switch” comparison section for visual consistency and scannability. Match site-wide container width, fix header duplication/colors, unblock tooltips, reduce the matrix to **4 columns** and **3 rows**, widen the row-title column, and center CTAs.

### 0) Scope & guardrails

* Touch **only** this section’s layout, data, and UI.
* Keep global tokens (colors, typography, spacing) and a11y patterns.
* Do **not** alter header, hero, other sections, or routes.

---

### 1) Match global section width & alignment

* Use the **same container component and max width** as other homepage sections (the ones rendering at ~**1526px** on desktop).

  * Remove any local hard caps (e.g., `max-w-1280`/`7xl`) on the section wrapper or table wrapper.
  * Ensure the **table uses the full container width** and inherits its paddings.
* Left-align the entire header block to match the rest of the page.

**Header copy (exact)**

* Eyebrow (muted, uppercase): `WHY TEAMS SWITCH`
* **H2:** `Why Teams Switch`
* Subtitle (support line, muted—not blue): `See it in one table.`
* Support sentence (below subtitle): `Projects with real dollars, hours, assets, and conversations—kept in one place so work flows and cash lands sooner.`

> Remove any duplicate occurrence of “Why Teams Switch” in the eyebrow/subtitle. Use the same color tokens as other section headers/subtitles (no blue subtitle).

### 2) Reduce matrix to **4 columns** (top differentiators) and **3 rows**

**Columns (left → right, exact labels + 1-line meanings for tooltips)**

1. **Project Management (multi–work orders)**
   Tooltip: `One project → many work orders, estimates, invoices—all linked.`
2. **Employee Labor & Payroll**
   Tooltip: `Wages + pay rules tied to time; project totals and payroll export.`
3. **GPS-Verified Timesheets**
   Tooltip: `Geo-verified in/out; hours summed at the project.`
4. **Asset Tracking & Inspection Integrations**
   Tooltip: `Property Organizer + Link Inspect Pro linked to projects/jobs.`

**Rows (top → bottom)**

1. **LinkServicePro** — highlight row subtly
2. **Other FSM Software (generic)**
3. **Spreadsheets (Excel/Sheets)**

> **Remove** the “Legacy Desktop System” and “4-App Patchwork” rows entirely.

**Cell states**

* LinkServicePro: ✓ for all 4 columns.
* Other FSM (generic): `~` for columns 1–3, `~` for column 4 if integrations are common in category, otherwise mix of `~` and `✕` per your judgment—keep conservative.
* Spreadsheets: `~` for Project Management (tab workarounds), `~` for Labor/Payroll (formulas), `✕` for GPS-Verified Timesheets, `✕` for Asset/Inspection integrations.

**Legend (above table, right-aligned on desktop; full-width row on mobile)**

* `✓ Included` (green) `– Partial / workaround` (amber) `✕ Missing` (red)
* **Add a tooltip to the amber hyphen**: `Partial or requires workarounds. Some steps may be manual or split across tools.`

### 3) Layout & readability of the matrix

* **First column width (row titles):** make it visibly wider so names never feel cramped. Target ~**26–28%** of table width on desktop, or a fixed **min-width** of at least **16–18ch**.
* **Header labels:** left-align; keep to **two lines max** with controlled wrapping (no truncation of key terms).
* **Row height:** consistent, compact; symbols centered; maintain touch targets and keyboard focusability.

**Sticky behavior**

* Keep **sticky header** and **sticky first column** on horizontal scroll.
* With only 4 columns, **disable the column picker** entirely; it’s no longer needed.
* Keep the horizontal scrollbar + gradient fades; ensure **no overflow clipping** anywhere.

---

### 4) Tooltips must not be blocked

* Remove/avoid `overflow: hidden` on any parent that clips tooltips.
* Render tooltips in a **portal** attached to `body` (or a top-level overlay layer) with a z-index above the table header/first column.
* Enable **smart placement** (flip/shift) so tooltips reposition when near edges.
* Tooltip triggers are keyboard focusable; ESC closes; `aria-describedby` connects trigger to content.
* Symbols (✓/–/✕) include **sr-only** text: `Included`, `Partial`, `Missing`.

---

### 5) Legal note & CTAs

* Keep the footnote under the table: `Generic rows reflect common patterns; availability varies by vendor/version.`
* **Center the CTA buttons** under the table (both visible with equal spacing):

  * Primary: `Get Started Free`
  * Secondary: `Talk to an expert`
* Ensure the secondary button has sufficient contrast and is not clipped at any breakpoint.

---

### 6) A11y & performance

* Semantic `<table>` with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th scope="col">`, `<th scope="row">`.
* Focus rings must be visible on legend trigger, header info icons, cells (if interactive), and CTAs.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` (no animated scroll-snap, no tooltip motion if reduced).
* Fixed column widths + intrinsic icon sizes to prevent CLS.

---

### 7) Acceptance checklist (verify before shipping)

* Section width matches other homepage bands (≈**1526px** container); header/subtitle left-aligned and using standard colors (subtitle not blue).
* Matrix shows **4 columns** and **3 rows** only; row order is **LinkServicePro**, **Other FSM Software (generic)**, **Spreadsheets (Excel/Sheets)**.
* First column (row titles) is wide and legible; no squish or truncation.
* Tooltips open **above all content**, never clipped, keyboard accessible, with the specified copy.
* Legend present; amber hyphen has the “Partial / workaround” tooltip.
* Sticky header/first column function correctly; horizontal scroll clean; no column picker.
* **CTAs are centered** and fully visible at all breakpoints.
* A11y and performance checks pass; no layout shift.

If any ambiguity arises about the exact min-width values, bias toward **readability over compactness**—this is a scannability section, not a density exercise.
