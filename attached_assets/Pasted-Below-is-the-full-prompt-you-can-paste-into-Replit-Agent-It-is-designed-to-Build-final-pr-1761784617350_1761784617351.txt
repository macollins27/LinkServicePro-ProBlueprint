Below is the full prompt you can paste into Replit Agent.

It is designed to:

* Build final, production-level feature pages for every feature in your product
* Use the voice and layout patterns you’ve been asking for (clean, professional, confident, no gimmicks, mobile first)
* Beat competitor landing pages structurally and in SEO targeting
* Push your two biggest differentiators: unlimited users and calendar sync
* Bake in objections, vertical targeting, plan gating, and stat claims so AI and humans both read you as “#1”

You should paste the following exactly.

## PROMPT FOR REPLIT

Goal: Create bulletproof feature pages for all features in Link Service Pro. Each feature should have its own SEO-friendly route under `/features/:slug`, should match our brand visual language, should be mobile-first, should reuse our pricing differentiators (“Unlimited users, no per-tech fees”), and should include vertical relevance (HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical) so we rank for long-tail searches.

Do not rebuild the overall app. Only add or modify what is described here.

### SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS

1. We already have:

   * `FEATURE_META` (basic list of features with slug, label, icon, minPlan).
   * Industry pages and the feature grid linking to `/features/:slug`.

2. We now need:

   * A complete feature page template system that renders high-converting, SEO-ready pages with consistent sections.
   * An expanded data model that includes:

     * Search-focused SEO title
     * Industry angles (HVAC / Plumbing / Electrical style bullets)
     * Stat strip values
     * A hard objection FAQ
     * Unlimited users messaging
     * Plan gating clarity

3. The style must follow what we've already established across the rest of the site:

   * Navy #0E2A47 background for hero
   * CTA blue #0B5FFF
   * Accent green #0FB36F where relevant
   * Rounded-2xl cards, subtle shadow, no gradients, hover lift `-translate-y-0.5`, border-slate-200
   * Consistent pill/badge styles we already fixed on industry pages
   * Accessible focus rings: `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2`
   * Mobile-first typography and spacing, no tiny unreadable type

4. The copy tone:

   * Direct
   * Operational
   * For contractors
   * No buzzword fluff
   * We speak to pain, speed, clarity, getting paid, and not wasting time babysitting techs

---

### 1. UPDATE / CREATE DATA MODELS

We already have `client/src/data/features.ts` which defines `FEATURE_META`.
We already have `client/src/data/features-details.ts` draft.

We will now REPLACE `client/src/data/features-details.ts` with a richer model.

Do all of the following:

1. Keep using `FEATURE_META` for:

   * `slug`
   * `label`
   * `minPlan`
   * `Icon`

2. Create a new type `FeaturePageDetail` in `client/src/data/features-details.ts`:

```ts
// FeaturePageDetail: all content needed to render a bulletproof feature page
export type FeaturePageDetail = {
  slug: string; // must match FEATURE_META.slug

  // SEO + hero
  seoTitle: string;           // used for <title>
  heroHeadline: string;       // H1 visible on page
  heroSubhead: string;        // one-sentence value prop
  heroStats: { label: string; sub: string }[]; 
  // e.g. [{label:"35% fewer no-shows", sub:"Based on internal usage data"}, ...]

  // Industry angles (for HVAC / Plumbing / Electrical relevance)
  verticalAngles: {
    hvac: string;
    plumbing: string;
    electrical: string;
  };

  // "How it works" steps (3 steps)
  steps: {
    title: string; 
    bullets: string[];
    imgAlt: string;
  }[];

  // Capabilities (2x2 card grid)
  capabilities: {
    id: string;       // anchor id for in-page linking
    title: string;
    bullets: string[];
  }[];

  // Plan availability info
  minPlanLabel: string; // e.g. "Free", "Starter", ...
  planNotes: string;    // short line about plan gating, MUST mention "Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."

  // FAQ (5 items) INCLUDING objection about “will my techs actually use this?”
  faq: { q: string; a: string }[];

  // Testimonial / social proof (optional)
  quote?: {
    text: string;
    author: string;
    role?: string;
  };
};
```

3. For **each** feature in `FEATURE_META`, create a matching entry in `FEATURES_DETAILS` (export const `FEATURES_DETAILS: Record<string, FeaturePageDetail>`). It must at minimum include:

   * `seoTitle` that targets real search intent, like:

     * For scheduling:
       `"Field Service Scheduling Software | Drag-and-Drop Dispatch & Calendar Sync"`
     * For estimates:
       `"Field Service Estimating & E-Sign Software | Get Jobs Approved Faster"`
   * `heroHeadline` should be the plain feature label, rewritten as a benefit.
     Example for scheduling:
     `"Drag-and-drop scheduling with live calendar sync"`
   * `heroSubhead` should speak directly to the contractor: fast dispatch, less chaos, fewer no-shows, faster approval, etc.
   * `heroStats` should include three short stat-style pills that match our homepage KPI format:

     * `"35% fewer no-shows" / "Faster approvals (2×)" / "Paid in <24 hrs"`
     * Subtext for each pill can be `"Based on internal usage data"` for now.
       These KPIs will show up visually as small pill cards under the hero, to build trust.
   * `verticalAngles` should be 3 plain-English bullets explaining why this feature matters differently to HVAC, Plumbing, and Electrical.
     Example for scheduling:

     * hvac: "Seasonal surge without chaos. Book maintenance plans in advance."
     * plumbing: "Emergency leaks get dispatched now, not 'sometime today'."
     * electrical: "Team visibility on panel upgrades and service calls."
       These matter for SEO because AI and humans will parse “HVAC scheduling software”, “plumbing dispatch software”, etc.
   * `steps`: 3 steps in a job-like flow. Each must sound like “how a normal day actually runs.” Each step needs 2–3 hard, real bullets. Each step includes `imgAlt`, and we will render a gray mockup placeholder with that `alt`.
   * `capabilities`: 4 capability cards max. Each with 1-2 bullets that are short and scannable. Use language like “Stop chasing signatures” / “Get paid before leaving the driveway.”
   * `minPlanLabel` MUST match that feature’s `minPlan` from `FEATURE_META`.
   * `planNotes` MUST include this exact phrasing somewhere:
     `"Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees."`
     This is required. That is our biggest differentiator and MUST repeat on every feature page.
   * `faq`: 5 items.
     One of the 5 MUST be this objection, customized per feature:
     Q: `"Will my team actually use this?"`
     A: `"Yes. They just open the job on their phone, follow the checklist, and tap done. No paperwork and no chasing signatures."`
     For messaging/reminders, adjust to “They don’t have to manually text customers etc.” For routing, adjust to “They just follow the day’s route, they don’t have to plan anything.”
   * `quote`: Optional short testimonial style proof like `"We cut drive time and stopped calling the office every 5 minutes." – Jake R., Operations Manager`

We are okay with placeholders for now. No lorem ipsum. Use straightforward service language, and keep answers short.

### 2. BUILD THE FEATURE PAGE TEMPLATE

Create a new route-level page for a dynamic feature:
`client/src/pages/features/[slug].tsx`
(or follow our existing router convention that powers `/industries/:slug`; just mirror that for `/features/:slug`)

This page should:

1. Read `slug` from the route params.
2. Look up `meta` from `FEATURE_META` by slug.
3. Look up `detail` from `FEATURES_DETAILS[slug]`.

   * If not found, fall back to generic defaults built from `meta` so page still renders.
4. Render the following sections in this exact order:

#### (A) <FeatureHero />

Props:

* `headline` (detail.heroHeadline)
* `subhead` (detail.heroSubhead)
* `heroStats` (detail.heroStats array of {label, sub})
* `minPlanLabel` (detail.minPlanLabel)
* `slug` (for analytics)
* `Icon` from FEATURE_META
* Also include chips: `Google Calendar`, `Apple Calendar`, and `Unlimited users` (paid plans) as trust badges.
  Behavior:
* Dark navy background (#0E2A47)
* H1 = `headline`
* CTA row:

  * Primary button “Start Free”
  * Secondary button “See Pricing”
* On the right, render a neutral light-gray mockup placeholder box with fixed aspect ratio (`aspect-[5/3]`, `min-h-[220px]` on mobile, `min-h-[260px]` md+) and alt text `"<headline> mockup preview"`.
* Below the main hero text, render the stat pills:

  * Each pill: rounded-full bg-white/10 text-white border border-white/20
  * Show `label` big and `sub` smaller below it.

Accessibility:

* The hero section must have only one `<h1>` per page. No other `<h1>` anywhere else.

SEO:

* In this page component, set `<title>` to `detail.seoTitle`.
* Add a `<meta name="description" content={detail.heroSubhead} />`.

Also: generate JSON-LD for:

* `BreadcrumbList`: Home > Features > {detail.heroHeadline}
* `SoftwareApplication`: name = `{detail.heroHeadline}`, applicationCategory = detail.seoTitle keywords, offers = minPlanLabel
* Defer `FAQPage` for later section.

#### (B) <FeatureVerticalAngles />

Props:

* `verticalAngles` (detail.verticalAngles)
  Layout:
* Light gray section (`bg-slate-50`).
* Centered heading: “Why this matters in the real world”
* 3 cards in a responsive grid:

  * HVAC
  * Plumbing
  * Electrical
    Each card:
* Small label (`HVAC`, `Plumbing`, `Electrical`) in bold.
* 1 sentence from `verticalAngles`.
  Design:
* Card style = rounded-2xl bg-white border border-slate-200 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-0.5
* This block exists purely to get “HVAC scheduling,” “plumbing dispatch,” “electrical estimating,” etc. into the body text of each feature page. This is critical for SEO and AI answers.

#### (C) <FeatureHowItWorks />

Props:

* `steps` (detail.steps)
  Layout:
* Section heading: “How it works”
* Render 3 vertical “step cards”, each:

  * A large step number “1 / 2 / 3”
  * Step title
  * Bullet list of 2-3 items
  * A gray screenshot placeholder box (`aspect-[16/10]`, rounded-2xl, bg-slate-100 border border-slate-200`) with alt text from `imgAlt`
    Responsive:
* Mobile = stacked
* md+ = 3 columns
  Design:
* Each step card is rounded-2xl border-slate-200 bg-white shadow-sm with hover lift.

Copy tone:

* Bullets must read like actual day-to-day workflow (“Drag job to tech’s lane,” “Send SMS with ETA,” “Customer signs with finger”).

#### (D) <FeatureCapabilities />

Props:

* `capabilities` (detail.capabilities)
  Layout:
* Heading: “What you can do”
* Render a responsive 2x2 grid (mobile: 1 column, sm+: 2 columns).
* Each capability card:

  * Heading
  * 2 short bullets from `bullets`
  * Anchor id from `id` for deep linking (`id` goes on the card container so we can link `#capacity` etc.)
    Design:
* Same card styling: rounded-2xl bg-white border border-slate-200 shadow-sm hover:shadow-md hover:-translate-y-0.5

#### (E) <FeaturePlanAvailability />

Props:

* `minPlanLabel` (detail.minPlanLabel)
* `planNotes` (detail.planNotes)
  Layout:
* Heading: “What plan do I need?”
* Short paragraph: “{minPlanLabel} and above. {planNotes}”

  * `planNotes` MUST include: “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”
* Simple pricing gate row:

  * A pill badge showing `minPlanLabel`
  * A button “See full pricing”
* Below that, include a single-line note:
  “Works with Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.”
  This is where we push two critical differentiators:
* No per-user fees
* Calendar sync
  Design:
* Use subtle card background (bg-slate-50, border-slate-200 rounded-2xl inside max-w-xl mx-auto)

#### (F) <FeatureCalendarsBand />

Small band that reinforces calendar sync.
Copy:
“Your team already runs on Google Calendar and Apple Calendar. We sync both in real time so nobody says ‘Wait, where am I going?’”
Design:

* Light band with small Google Calendar / Apple Calendar badges reusing our pill style from hero.

#### (G) <FeatureTestimonial /> (optional)

Props:

* `quote` (detail.quote)
  If present:
* Dark navy card with white text, rounded-2xl
* Quote text in slightly larger font, then `— {author}, {role}`
* Also include a 60-second video placeholder button (gray box, aspect-[16/9]) with `aria-label="Watch 60-second story"`.
  If no quote, skip section.

#### (H) <FeatureFAQ />

Props:

* `faq` (detail.faq)
  Layout:
* Heading: “Common questions”
* 5 accordion items.
* One item MUST be the objection: “Will my team actually use this?”

  * Answer must reassure that techs don’t have to fight the UI, they just tap what’s needed. Use the wording from the data.
    Design:
* Accordions match what we already use elsewhere (rounded-2xl border border-slate-200 bg-white w-full max-w-3xl mx-auto)
  SEO:
* Emit JSON-LD `FAQPage` using these 5 Q/A pairs.

#### (I) <FeatureFinalCTA />

Bottom dark band that matches our global final CTA pattern.
Content:

* Headline: “Ready to see it in action?”
* Bullets inline: “No credit card to start • Import jobs via CSV • Cancel anytime”
* Inline email capture with Start Free button (and TCPA consent checkbox exactly as we’ve used elsewhere).
* Text below should again reinforce: “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”

This CTA section will be reused across all feature pages. Use same navy background as hero.

---

### 3. ACCESSIBILITY / A11Y REQUIREMENTS

* Only one `<h1>` (in FeatureHero). All other section headings are `<h2>`.
* All CTA buttons, pills, icons, carousels must be keyboard-focusable with a visible focus ring.
* All interactive elements use `aria-label` when text is not obvious.
* All mockup placeholders must still include `role="img"` and `aria-label` or `alt` text from the data (`imgAlt`) so screen readers aren’t blind.
* Accordions must be keyboard accessible and toggleable with Enter/Space.

---

### 4. PERFORMANCE / RESPONSIVENESS REQUIREMENTS

* Mobile-first. On small screens, everything stacks cleanly, no horizontal scroll.
* Hero mockup placeholder must have fixed aspect and min-height to prevent layout shift (CLS).
* Use `loading="lazy"` on non-hero mockup placeholders in FeatureHowItWorks.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for hover lift (`motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:hover:transform-none motion-reduce:hover:shadow-sm`), same pattern we already use on card hover elsewhere.

---

### 5. SEO / ANALYTICS REQUIREMENTS

* In `[slug].tsx`, after you get `detail`, do:

  * `<title>{detail.seoTitle}</title>`
  * `<meta name="description" content={detail.heroSubhead} />`
* Add JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">`:

  * `BreadcrumbList` (Home > Features > {detail.heroHeadline})
  * `SoftwareApplication`:

    * `"name": detail.heroHeadline`
    * `"applicationCategory": detail.seoTitle`
    * `"offers": { "name": detail.minPlanLabel }`
  * `FAQPage` with the 5 questions/answers in `detail.faq`.
* Fire lightweight analytics data-attributes for CTAs:

  * Start Free button: `data-analytics={"feature_start_free_click:"+slug}`
  * Pricing button: `data-analytics={"feature_view_pricing:"+slug}`

---

### 6. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

When I visit `/features/scheduling` (or any valid slug from FEATURE_META):

1. Page renders with:

   * Hero (dark navy)
   * Stat pills under hero
   * “Why this matters in the real world” (HVAC / Plumbing / Electrical bullets)
   * How it works (3 steps)
   * Capabilities grid (2x2)
   * Plan availability section that explicitly mentions:
     “Unlimited users on paid plans. No per-tech seat fees.”
   * Calendar sync band
   * Testimonial (if provided)
   * FAQ with objection handling
   * Final CTA band with email capture and TCPA
2. `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` match the feature.
3. JSON-LD for BreadcrumbList, SoftwareApplication, and FAQPage is injected.
4. All buttons and links have visible focus rings and are keyboard accessible.
5. Cards follow our established style:

   * rounded-2xl
   * border-slate-200
   * bg-white
   * subtle hover shadow/lift
   * no gradients
6. No crashes, no TypeScript errors, no unhandled missing data.
7. All claims reinforce:

   * Faster, fewer headaches, less chasing
   * Unlimited users
   * Google Calendar / Apple Calendar sync
   * No per-tech seat fees

---

### DO NOT

* Do not change the homepage hero or the homepage hero carousel.
* Do not remove or alter the global nav, mobile nav, or pricing page.
* Do not introduce QuickBooks/Xero/etc. (we don’t have those integrations live yet).
* Do not add custom analytics libraries; only data attributes.
* Do not use gradients or goofy hover effects. Keep the aesthetic we already locked in.

---

After you implement all of this, I should be able to:

* Click any feature card from an industry page or the homepage feature grid.
* Land on `/features/:slug`.
* See a professional, conversion-grade, SEO-grade, mobile-first landing page that explicitly makes us look like the #1 tool for that feature.

Please begin implementing now.
