## Objective

Create a **mobile-first Industries index page** that acts as a high-converting, SEO-optimized hub for all trades we serve. It must deliver a clear wow factor, be fast, accessible, and drive clicks into individual industry pages.

Do the work now. Build the page at `/industries`.

---

## Rules

* Mobile first at 375px. No horizontal scroll. Tap targets ≥44px.
* Sharp corners. High contrast (AA). Bold rectangular buttons. Link underline animates right→left.
* Every section begins with **Title + Subtitle** at the **top-left**.
* Sticky bottom CTA across the page. Inline lead form above the fold.
* **One AI-generated hero image** (no screens/UI; see spec below). Reuse blurred as a subtle backdrop mid-page.
* Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Lazy-load non-hero assets.

## Page structure (exact order)

1. **Hero band**

   * **Title:** “Industry Solutions”
   * **Subtitle:** “Purpose-built workflows for every trade—scheduling, dispatch, and payments in one place.”
   * **KPI tiles (3):** `+24% Win rate`, `−18% Drive time`, `+37% Same-day pay`
   * Primary CTA: **Start Free**. Secondary: **View Pricing**.
   * **Single AI image** full-bleed (see Image spec).

2. **Find your trade (search + smart filters)**

   * Search input filters card titles in real time.
   * Filter pills for three clusters:

     * **Exterior & Grounds**: Lawn Care, Landscaping, Tree Care, Snow Removal, Pressure Washing, Window Cleaning
     * **Home & Building Services**: Cleaning, Janitorial Cleaning, Handyman, Painting, General Contracting
     * **Mechanical & Electrical**: HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical, Roofing
   * Show “All” by default. Active pill has bold state.

3. **Industries grid (cards)**

   * Mobile: 1-column. ≥768px: 2-column. ≥1024px: 3-column.
   * Card content:

     * Industry name
     * One-line hook in plain language (see list below)
     * 3 quick benefits (short bullets)
     * **CTA:** “See {Industry} page →”
   * Card visuals: **pictogram badge** (AI-generated line icon, no screens) + small background texture. Keep contrast high.

4. **What you get (platform value)**

   * 6 icon cards linking to Features: Scheduling, Dispatch + Live Map, Route Optimization, Work Orders, Quote + E-Sign, Invoicing & Payments.
   * Copy pattern: Action → Outcome in 6–10 words.

5. **How it works for any trade (3 steps)**

   * Step 1: Intake & Quote → *Capture requests and build estimates.*
   * Step 2: Schedule & Dispatch → *Drag-drop jobs and assign crews.*
   * Step 3: Do the work & Get paid → *Photo proof, invoice, and tap-to-pay.*

6. **Proof from the field**

   * 3 short testimonials (HVAC, Landscaping, Cleaning). Name + role + one sentence.

7. **Mini demo + lead capture**

   * Left: poster image placeholder (reuse hero blur); 3 captions listing what the viewer will see.
   * Right: compact lead form (email + company) titled “See it with your jobs.” One-line success.

8. **FAQ (accordion, 5 items)**

   * Short answers. Contractor language.

9. **Bottom CTA band**

   * “Ready to try it?”  → **View Pricing** and **Start Free**.

10. **Sticky bottom CTA**

* Always visible. Same buttons.

## AI imagery (one image total for this page)

**Goal:** Authentic, documentary, **no screens**. Use it as the Hero image and as a subtle backdrop in “How it works.”

**Prompt:**
“Crew huddle at dawn beside service vans, foreman holding **printed route sheets**, mixed trades gear visible (ladders, hose reels, tool cases), reflective vests and gloves, natural light, shallow depth, moderate contrast, OSHA-safe, tight crop on hands and gear, 35mm composition, **no screens visible**, no third-party logos.”

**Output:** AVIF + WebP + JPEG at **1600 / 1200 / 768 / 480** widths + **LQIP 20px blur**.
**Alt:** Field crews reviewing printed route sheets by the vans.
**Caption:** Ready before the first stop.
