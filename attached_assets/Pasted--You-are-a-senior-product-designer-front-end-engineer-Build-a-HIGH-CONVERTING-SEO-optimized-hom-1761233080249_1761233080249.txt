
You are a senior product designer + front-end engineer. Build a HIGH-CONVERTING, SEO-optimized homepage for “LinkServicePro” (field service management software). Deliver a complete, production-ready single page (React + Vite + Tailwind). No lorem ipsum. Plain contractor language. Fast, accessible, and distinct from competitors.

STACK & FILES
- React + Vite + Tailwind only. src/main.jsx, src/App.jsx, src/components/*, src/styles/underline.css, index.html, tailwind.css.
- Mobile-first. Ship <80KB CSS. No heavy libs. Use small CSS for custom effects.

UNIQUE LOOK & FEEL: “Pro-Blueprint”
- Aesthetic: premium, rugged, tool-grade. Clean layout with subtle blueprint grid + paper texture overlays (CSS only, no images).
- Colors: Ink #0F172A, Blueprint #0B5FFF, Safety Teal #00C2A8, Accent Amber #F59E0B, Neutrals #111827/#374151/#E5E7EB.
- Typography: Inter or system stack. Headings 700. Body 400–500. Buttons 800. No rounded corners (rounded-none).
- Components use “rivet” details: thin 1px borders, micro shadows, small corner notches on cards (clip-path) for a distinctive look.
- Active section tabs use a colored “staple” indicator (2px tall full-width top border).
- Link hover = RIGHT→LEFT drawn underline (see CSS spec below). Active nav item shows persistent underline.

ACCESSIBILITY
- WCAG AA+ contrast. All menus keyboard navigable. Visible focus states. aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-current where relevant.
- Reduced motion media query respected.

NAVBAR (sticky)
- Left: wordmark “LinkServicePro”.
- Center nav: Features (megamenu), Industries (dropdown), Pricing, Resources. Apply custom underline hover and persistent active underline on “Pricing”.
- Right: Sign in (text) + primary CTA [Start Free Trial]. Secondary CTA [Book a Demo] appears on mobile menu.
- Megamenu (Features): 3 columns with short one-liners.
  1) Plan & Dispatch: Drag-and-drop Scheduling; Dispatch Board + Live Map; Route Optimization; Real-time GPS; Capacity Planning; Automated Reminders; Recurring Jobs.
