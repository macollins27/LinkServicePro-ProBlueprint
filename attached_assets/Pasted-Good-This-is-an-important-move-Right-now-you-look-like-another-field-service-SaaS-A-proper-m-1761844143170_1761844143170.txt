Good. This is an important move.

Right now you look like “another field service SaaS.” A proper mega menu instantly communicates depth, authority, and credibility — especially to buyers who are just hovering and scanning. It also feeds SEO (internal linking) and helps AI understand your product surface.

We’re going to design **two separate desktop mega menus**:

* **Features**
* **Industries**

Both:

* Respect your current theme (navy #0E2A47, accent #0B5FFF, slate neutrals, rounded-xl surfaces, focus-visible rings)
* Mobile-first: On mobile they should collapse into a standard slide-in or accordion nav (not a full mega flyout filling the screen)
* Desktop: Full-width or large flyout, layered card aesthetic, not cheap dropdowns

You’ll give Replit a single prompt after this. First I’ll describe what each should look like and what must be inside. Then I’ll write the prompt Replit needs.

---

## PART 1. DESIGN RULES (APPLY TO BOTH MEGA MENUS)

**Trigger behavior**

* On desktop: When user hovers (or focuses via keyboard) on “Features” or “Industries” in the top nav, a large flyout panel appears below the header.
* On mobile: Don’t show a huge flyout. Instead, “Features” and “Industries” just expand accordion sections in the mobile nav drawer. (Replit should not break your existing mobile menu. We’re just adding structure there.)

**Positioning + container**

* The flyout panel is positioned under the nav bar, aligned with the left edge of the header container (not the full browser width).
* Panel container:

  ```text
  bg-white
  text-slate-900
  shadow-[0_24px_64px_rgba(0,0,0,0.4)]
  ring-1 ring-slate-200
  rounded-2xl
  p-6
  w-[min(800px,90vw)]
  grid gap-6
  ```
* On desktop, ESC closes it. On tabbing out, it closes. Click outside closes. We’re not doing weird animation yet — Replit can optionally add a subtle Framer Motion fade/translate-y-[4px] in 150ms for polish.

**Inside the panel**

* We’re not dumping 40 links. We’re using **visual hierarchy**, which does 3 things:

  1. Shows the most important actions immediately (top-left).
  2. Gives credibility (card with “highlighted” feature or industry).
  3. Gives routes for deeper browsing: “View all features →” / “See all industries →”.

**Focus & a11y**

* Each link in the mega menu must be keyboard-focusable, with:
  `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded`
* Each link is a Wouter `<Link href="...">`, not a `<a>`.

**Icon style**

* Every item row has a leading icon:

  * `w-5 h-5 text-[#0B5FFF] flex-shrink-0`
  * Use lucide icons that actually make sense for that item (wrench for dispatch/scheduling, receipt for invoicing, etc.).
* Icons are not all identical. That was one of your complaints.

**Microcopy style**

* Each row in the mega menu is a 2-line description, not just a label. That’s the wow: you’re selling, not just linking.
* Label line: bold-ish, `text-[14px] font-semibold text-slate-900`
* Support line: `text-[12px] text-slate-500 leading-snug max-w-[240px]`
* Whole row is clickable, has hover bg-slate-50 rounded-lg p-2 transition.

Now let’s do each menu.

---

## PART 2. FEATURES MEGA MENU (DESKTOP)

### Goal

Immediately show: “This software runs your business end to end — schedule → job → invoice → get paid → recurring revenue → reporting.”

We’re going to group features into logical buckets:

1. Run the work
2. Get paid
3. Grow and control

We will also include a promo tile on the right with a navy background showing social proof / differentiator (unlimited users, seat-free).

### Layout (desktop)

The flyout is a 2-column grid on desktop:

**Left column (main links)**

* Column uses a 3-section vertical stack. Each section has a tiny heading and then 2–3 feature rows.

Section “Scheduling & Field Work”

* Scheduling & Dispatch

  * Link: `/features/scheduling-dispatch`
  * Icon: calendar / route icon
  * Subtext: “Drag-and-drop scheduling, live dispatch board, route planning.”
* Work Orders & Mobile

  * Link: `/features/work-orders-mobile`
  * Icon: clipboard-check / mobile-device icon
  * Subtext: “Every job step on the tech’s phone, with photos and signatures.”
* Team Management & Operations Control

  * Link: `/features/team-management`
  * Icon: users icon
  * Subtext: “Assign tasks, track completion, control permissions.”

Section “Quotes, Invoices & Payments”

* Estimates & Quotes

  * Link: `/features/estimates-quotes`
  * Icon: file-signature
  * Subtext: “On-site estimates with e-sign, no paper, no chasing.”
* Invoicing & Payments

  * Link: `/features/invoicing-payments`
  * Icon: credit-card
  * Subtext: “Invoice instantly, take deposits, collect card payments in the field.”

Section “Recurring Work & Profit”

* Maintenance Plans & Recurring Jobs

  * Link: `/features/maintenance-plans`
  * Icon: repeat / refresh-cw
  * Subtext: “Lock in repeat revenue with automated service schedules.”
* Job Costing & Reporting

  * Link: `/features/job-costing-reporting`
  * Icon: bar-chart
  * Subtext: “Track profitability by job, crew, or tech in plain English.”

Below these sections, add a small link row:

* “View all features →”

  * Link: `/features`
  * Style: `text-[12px] font-semibold text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline flex items-center gap-1`
  * This is to drive them to the full Features overview page you already built.

**Right column (highlight tile)**
Card with navy background to sell the differentiator:

```html
<div className="bg-[#0E2A47] text-white rounded-xl p-4 flex flex-col justify-between ring-1 ring-slate-800 shadow-inner min-h-[180px]">
  <div>
    <div className="text-[11px] font-semibold text-white/80 bg-white/10 border border-white/20 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] inline-block mb-3">
      Unlimited users
    </div>
    <div className="text-white font-semibold text-base leading-snug">
      Stop paying per tech.
    </div>
    <div className="text-white/70 text-[12px] leading-snug mt-2">
      Pick a job cap, not a seat cap. Add as many users as you want on paid plans.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="mt-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
    <Link
      href="/pricing"
      className="bg-[#0B5FFF] text-white text-[12px] font-semibold rounded-md px-3 py-2 text-center shadow-sm hover:opacity-90 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none"
    >
      View Pricing
    </Link>
    <Link
      href="/compare"
      className="text-white/80 text-[12px] font-semibold text-center hover:text-white hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
    >
      Compare vs seat-based →
    </Link>
  </div>
</div>
```

This tile is what makes the menu feel like a landing page, not just a list. It screams “we’re different.”

---

## PART 3. INDUSTRIES MEGA MENU (DESKTOP)

We are not going to vomit 40 trades in a wall. That was the problem.

We’ll do:

* A “Popular trades” grid for instant credibility
* A “More industries” compact list
* A proof tile (right column) talking about credibility and speed

And we will still group them in a way where HVAC guy or plumber instantly sees himself.

### Layout (desktop)

Also a 2-column layout.

**Left column**
Top mini-heading: “Who we’re built for”
Style for mini-heading:
`text-[11px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-500 mb-2`

Then a 2x2 card grid showing four high-value industries (the most common and highest $$$ work orders in your space):

1. HVAC

   * Link: `/industries/hvac`
   * Icon: wind / thermometer-snowflake
   * Label: “HVAC”
   * Subtext `text-[12px] text-slate-500 leading-snug`: “Seasonal demand, maintenance plans, emergency calls.”
   * Card style:
     `rounded-lg p-3 hover:bg-slate-50 transition focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none`
   * Heading class: `text-[14px] font-semibold text-slate-900 flex items-center gap-2`
2. Plumbing

   * Link `/industries/plumbing`
   * Icon: droplet
   * Subtext: “Urgent dispatch, after-hours jobs, invoices on the spot.”
3. Electrical

   * Link `/industries/electrical`
   * Icon: zap
   * Subtext: “Safety + documentation every visit.”
4. Cleaning / Janitorial

   * Link `/industries/cleaning`
   * Icon: sparkles or broom
   * Subtext: “Recurring contracts, team scheduling, shift accountability.”

Below that grid, a list block “More industries we support”:
Style:
`mt-4 border-t border-slate-200 pt-4`
Then a multi-column responsive list (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile). Each is `text-[12px] text-slate-600 leading-snug hover:text-slate-900 hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded`.

Include:

* Landscaping & Lawn Care → `/industries/landscaping`
* Roofing → `/industries/roofing`
* Garage Door → `/industries/garage-door`
* Pest Control → `/industries/pest`
* Restoration & Remediation → `/industries/restoration`
* Pressure Washing → `/industries/pressure-washing`
* Property Maintenance / Handyman → `/industries/handyman`
* Pool & Spa Service → `/industries/pool-spa`

Then a final link row:
“See all industries →”
Link `/industries`
Class:
`text-[12px] font-semibold text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline flex items-center gap-1 mt-4`

**Right column**
We sell outcomes to the owner.

```html
<div className="bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl p-4 flex flex-col justify-between ring-1 ring-slate-800 shadow-inner min-h-[180px]">
  <div>
    <div className="text-[11px] font-semibold text-white/80 bg-white/10 border border-white/20 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] inline-block mb-3">
      Built for the field
    </div>
    <div className="text-white font-semibold text-base leading-snug">
      “Where’s my tech?” stops being your job.
    </div>
    <div className="text-white/70 text-[12px] leading-snug mt-2">
      Live dispatch board, route planning, and job status — even if you’re running 5 calls at once.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="mt-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
    <Link
      href="/features/scheduling-dispatch"
      className="bg-[#0B5FFF] text-white text-[12px] font-semibold rounded-md px-3 py-2 text-center shadow-sm hover:opacity-90 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none"
    >
      See Scheduling & Dispatch
    </Link>
    <Link
      href="/pricing"
      className="text-white/80 text-[12px] font-semibold text-center hover:text-white hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
    >
      View Pricing →
    </Link>
  </div>
</div>
```

That right column gives emotional payoff: “You get control. You’re not babysitting.”

This is the wow factor: you’re not just listing industries, you’re talking to the pain point in plain language.

---

## PART 4. MOBILE BEHAVIOR

On mobile:

* No giant flyout.
* Your existing hamburger / slide-over nav should expand “Features” and “Industries” into accordions.

  * Accordion heading is tappable text.
  * Inside each accordion panel:

    * Show the same link groups, but in a simple vertical stack with icons on the left and text on the right.
    * Skip the promo tile / big card — mobile global nav drawers should stay lean.
    * Still include “View all features →” and “See all industries →” at the bottom of each accordion.
* All links still have focus-visible ring classes for accessibility.

---

## PART 5. ACCESSIBILITY / INTERACTION RULES

For desktop mega menu:

* The parent nav item (e.g. `<button>` or `<div role="button">Features`) must be keyboard focusable.
* When it receives focus or hover, show panel.
* Panel `role="dialog"` or `role="menu"` is okay, but it must trap focus only if you’re doing ESC-close; otherwise allow normal tabbing.
* ESC key should hide menu.
* Clicking anywhere outside panel should hide menu.

For mobile accordion:

* Use semantic `<button aria-expanded="true/false" aria-controls="...">` for the accordion headers.

We’re not telling Replit to write a huge focus trap hook if that blows things up. We are telling it: implement hover+focus open for desktop, accordion for mobile, with Tailwind classes as specified.

---

## PART 6. ONE PROMPT FOR REPLIT

Now here is what you will paste to Replit to build this, using your current stack (React + Vite + Wouter + Tailwind + lucide-react + Framer Motion already in project). This will update the header/nav component(s) only. It must NOT rebuild your site or touch hero carousel code.

```txt
You are Replit Agent. Do NOT rebuild the project. We are using React + Vite + Wouter + Tailwind. Keep the existing header/nav component and hero carousel logic exactly as-is EXCEPT we are upgrading the nav dropdown behavior for "Features" and "Industries". Mobile-first, desktop second.

GOALS
1. Add two mega menus in the desktop nav: one for “Features”, one for “Industries”.
2. Add corresponding accordion sections in the mobile nav drawer for those same two sections.
3. Keep design fully aligned with our current palette:
   - Navy #0E2A47
   - Accent blue #0B5FFF for CTAs, focus rings, icons
   - Slate neutrals for text and backgrounds
   - Rounded-xl, ring-1, shadow-[0_24px_64px_rgba(0,0,0,0.4)] aesthetic
4. All links must use Wouter <Link> and include focus-visible ring classes for accessibility.

A) DESKTOP BEHAVIOR
In the desktop header nav:
- The “Features” top-level item should open a large flyout panel on hover OR keyboard focus.
- The “Industries” top-level item should open a similar flyout panel.

Shared flyout panel wrapper styles:
<div
  className="absolute left-0 top-full z-50 bg-white text-slate-900 shadow-[0_24px_64px_rgba(0,0,0,0.4)] ring-1 ring-slate-200 rounded-2xl p-6 w-[min(800px,90vw)] grid gap-6"
>
This panel should be positioned below the nav bar, visually attached to that nav item.

Ensure:
- ESC closes panel.
- Clicking outside closes panel.
- Tab/Shift+Tab navigation doesn’t trap the user permanently.

B) FEATURES MEGA MENU CONTENT (DESKTOP)
Inside the Features flyout, create a 2-column responsive layout (stack on <md, 2 cols on md+):

LEFT COLUMN:
Section heading “Scheduling & Field Work” (use text-[11px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-500 mb-1)
Then 3 link rows. Each row is a clickable block:
<div className="flex items-start gap-3 p-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-slate-50 transition focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none">
  <Icon className="w-5 h-5 text-[#0B5FFF] flex-shrink-0" />
  <div>
    <div className="text-[14px] font-semibold text-slate-900 flex items-center gap-1">
      Scheduling & Dispatch
    </div>
    <div className="text-[12px] text-slate-500 leading-snug max-w-[240px]">
      Drag-and-drop scheduling, live dispatch board, route planning.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

That row should wrap a <Link href="/features/scheduling-dispatch" ...> so the entire block is clickable. Use proper focus-visible ring classes on the Link.

Repeat with:
- Work Orders & Mobile → /features/work-orders-mobile
  Subtext: “Every job step on the tech’s phone, with photos and signatures.”
- Team Management & Operations Control → /features/team-management
  Subtext: “Assign tasks, track completion, and lock down permissions.”

Next heading “Quotes, Invoices & Payments”, then:
- Estimates & Quotes → /features/estimates-quotes
  “On-site estimates with e-sign, no paper, no chasing.”
- Invoicing & Payments → /features/invoicing-payments
  “Invoice instantly, take deposits, collect card payments in the field.”

Next heading “Recurring Work & Profit”, then:
- Maintenance Plans & Recurring Jobs → /features/maintenance-plans
  “Lock in repeat revenue with automated service schedules.”
- Job Costing & Reporting → /features/job-costing-reporting
  “Track profitability by job, crew, or tech in plain English.”

At the bottom, below these sections, include:
<Link
  href="/features"
  className="text-[12px] font-semibold text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline flex items-center gap-1 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
>
  View all features →
</Link>

RIGHT COLUMN:
Add a promo tile card:

<div className="bg-[#0E2A47] text-white rounded-xl p-4 flex flex-col justify-between ring-1 ring-slate-800 shadow-inner min-h-[180px]">
  <div>
    <div className="text-[11px] font-semibold text-white/80 bg-white/10 border border-white/20 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] inline-block mb-3">
      Unlimited users
    </div>
    <div className="text-white font-semibold text-base leading-snug">
      Stop paying per tech.
    </div>
    <div className="text-white/70 text-[12px] leading-snug mt-2">
      Pick a job cap, not a seat cap. Add as many users as you want on paid plans.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="mt-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
    <Link
      href="/pricing"
      className="bg-[#0B5FFF] text-white text-[12px] font-semibold rounded-md px-3 py-2 text-center shadow-sm hover:opacity-90 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none"
    >
      View Pricing
    </Link>
    <Link
      href="/compare"
      className="text-white/80 text-[12px] font-semibold text-center hover:text-white hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
    >
      Compare vs seat-based →
    </Link>
  </div>
</div>

C) INDUSTRIES MEGA MENU CONTENT (DESKTOP)
Another flyout panel using same wrapper classes, different internal layout.

This panel is also 2 columns on md+, stacked on <md.

LEFT COLUMN:
Top mini-heading:
<div className="text-[11px] font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide text-slate-500 mb-2">
  Who we’re built for
</div>

Then a 2x2 grid of clickable industry cards, each card:
<div className="rounded-lg p-3 hover:bg-slate-50 transition focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none">
  <div className="text-[14px] font-semibold text-slate-900 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Icon className="w-5 h-5 text-[#0B5FFF]" />
    HVAC
  </div>
  <div className="text-[12px] text-slate-500 leading-snug mt-1">
    Seasonal demand, maintenance plans, emergency calls.
  </div>
</div>

Do 4 cards that link to:
- HVAC → /industries/hvac
- Plumbing → /industries/plumbing
  “Urgent dispatch, after-hours jobs, invoices on the spot.”
- Electrical → /industries/electrical
  “Safety and documentation every visit.”
- Cleaning / Janitorial → /industries/cleaning
  “Recurring contracts, team scheduling, shift accountability.”

Below that grid, add a thin divider:
<div className="border-t border-slate-200 pt-4 mt-4" />

Then 2-column text link list (on mobile stack to 1 col) with each <Link> className:
"text-[12px] text-slate-600 leading-snug hover:text-slate-900 hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded block"

Links:
- Landscaping & Lawn Care → /industries/landscaping
- Roofing → /industries/roofing
- Garage Door → /industries/garage-door
- Pest Control → /industries/pest
- Restoration & Remediation → /industries/restoration
- Pressure Washing → /industries/pressure-washing
- Property Maintenance / Handyman → /industries/handyman
- Pool & Spa Service → /industries/pool-spa

Then:
<Link
  href="/industries"
  className="text-[12px] font-semibold text-[#0B5FFF] hover:underline flex items-center gap-1 mt-4 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
>
  See all industries →
</Link>

RIGHT COLUMN:
Promo tile card for operations pain:

<div className="bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl p-4 flex flex-col justify-between ring-1 ring-slate-800 shadow-inner min-h-[180px]">
  <div>
    <div className="text-[11px] font-semibold text-white/80 bg-white/10 border border-white/20 rounded-full px-2 py-[3px] inline-block mb-3">
      Built for the field
    </div>
    <div className="text-white font-semibold text-base leading-snug">
      “Where’s my tech?” stops being your job.
    </div>
    <div className="text-white/70 text-[12px] leading-snug mt-2">
      Live dispatch board, route planning, and job status — even if you’re running 5 calls at once.
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="mt-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
    <Link
      href="/features/scheduling-dispatch"
      className="bg-[#0B5FFF] text-white text-[12px] font-semibold rounded-md px-3 py-2 text-center shadow-sm hover:opacity-90 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none"
    >
      See Scheduling & Dispatch
    </Link>
    <Link
      href="/pricing"
      className="text-white/80 text-[12px] font-semibold text-center hover:text-white hover:underline focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"
    >
      View Pricing →
    </Link>
  </div>
</div>

D) MOBILE NAV BEHAVIOR
In the mobile nav drawer / menu component:
- Convert “Features” and “Industries” into accordions.
- Each accordion header is a <button> with:
  aria-expanded (true/false)
  aria-controls="features-panel" or "industries-panel"
  className="w-full flex items-center justify-between text-left text-base font-semibold text-slate-900 py-3 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none"

When expanded:
- Show a vertical stack of the same links as desktop, but simplified:
  For Features accordion:
    Scheduling & Dispatch
    Work Orders & Mobile
    Estimates & Quotes
    Invoicing & Payments
    Maintenance Plans & Recurring Jobs
    Job Costing & Reporting
    Team Management & Operations Control
    View all features →
  Each item is a <Link> with className="flex items-start gap-3 py-2 text-[14px] text-slate-700 hover:text-slate-900 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded"

  Icon to the left with className="w-5 h-5 text-[#0B5FFF] flex-shrink-0"

For Industries accordion:
  HVAC
  Plumbing
  Electrical
  Cleaning / Janitorial
  Landscaping & Lawn Care
  Roofing
  Garage Door
  Pest Control
  Restoration & Remediation
  Property Maintenance / Handyman
  Pool & Spa Service
  See all industries →
Same link/focus classes.

We do NOT include the promo cards in mobile accordion. Keep mobile menu light.

E) DO NOT BREAK HEADER OR CAROUSEL
Do not touch:
- Existing hero carousel code
- Logo / brand alignment in header
- CTA buttons in header

Just enhance “Features” and “Industries” so they trigger these new menus on desktop and accordions on mobile.

F) ACCESSIBILITY
All <Link> and clickable <div> wrappers inside the mega menu should either:
- Be actual <Link> that spans the row, OR
- Contain a <Link> that fills 100% width and height so the entire tile is clickable.

All interactive elements require:
focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#0B5FFF] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-none rounded

Implement all of the above now.
```

That’s the full spec.

After Replit builds this:

* You’ll have a premium-level nav that feels like ServiceTitan pricing tier without the bloated enterprise stink.
* You communicate “we run the whole job lifecycle.”
