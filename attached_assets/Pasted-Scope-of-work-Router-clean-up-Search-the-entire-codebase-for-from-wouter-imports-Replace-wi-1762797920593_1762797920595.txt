Scope of work


Router clean-up


Search the entire codebase for from "wouter" imports.


Replace with react-router-dom (BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link).


Refactor all <Link> components accordingly.


Add Jest test routes.test.tsx that mounts App and asserts every defined route renders without 404.




Broken-link assurance


Write a Cypress test links.cy.ts that crawls the built site (/dist) and fails on any 4xx/5xx.




Industry landing pages (dynamic)


Create a param-based route /industry/:slug that renders IndustryPage.


Data lives in /src/data/industries.ts; seed with HVAC, Plumbing, Electrical (title, hero tagline, feature highlights, testimonial).


If slug not found, redirect to /industries.




Case-study template


Component CaseStudyPage with MDX support (use @mdx-js/react).


Add one example file hvac-time-saved.mdx (load time saved KPI, quote, before/after).




Structured data


Add <HowTo> JSON-LD component for blog posts that include <ol> with data-howto-step.


Embed <VideoObject> JSON-LD in HeroVideo component (src=/assets/90s-tour.mp4).




Tracking & analytics


Install GA4 (REACT_APP_GA_ID env) and PostHog (REACT_APP_PH_KEY).


Fire events: StartFree_Click, Signup_Submit, Guide_Download.




Design consistency


Create /src/components/BlueprintBackground.tsx and import it into all page layouts.


Ensure Primary/Secondary buttons consume centralized Button.tsx props instead of ad-hoc classes.




Performance budget


Add bundlewatch with limit 150 kB gzipped for initial JS.


Fail CI if limit exceeded.




Deliverables


Passing Jest + Cypress + bundlewatch in CI.


Feature branches merged, no eslint/stylelint errors.


Update README.md with yarn test, yarn cy:run, and analytics env-var setup.
