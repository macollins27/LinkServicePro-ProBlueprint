REPLACE: client/src/sections/ContractorWorkflowRail.tsx

GOAL
- Remove empty space.
- Swap “Preview” for real media (screenshot or short MP4/WebM).
- Reorder as a left vertical stepper (1→4) and a right “evidence” pane.
- Tight, professional, mobile-first. WCAG AA. Use lucide-react icons.

ASSETS (you will load these if available; otherwise show a clean placeholder):
/public/img/previews/estimates.jpg
/public/img/previews/scheduling.jpg
/public/img/previews/workorders.jpg
/public/img/previews/invoicing.jpg
// optional 8–12s loops:
// /public/video/estimates.webm, scheduling.webm, workorders.webm, invoicing.webm

LEFT: NUMBERED STEPPER (ordered conception→completion)
- Items: estimates, scheduling, workorders, invoicing (in that order).
- Each item shows: number badge, icon, title, 2–3 bullets only.
- Active item gets blue left border and light blue bg.
- Sticky at ≥1024px.

Use lucide-react icons:
FileSignature, CalendarDays, ClipboardCheck, CreditCard
Number badge: solid #0B5FFF, white text, 24px square.

RIGHT: EVIDENCE PANE (kills empty space)
- Header bar: icon + Title + one-line outcome.
- Media area 16:9; prefer video if exists, else screenshot; fallback to tidy placeholder.
- Under media: “Key features” links row (wrap) and a dense 2×2 spec grid (chips).
- Remove the old chip row that stretched too wide.

INTERACTION
- useState<'estimates'|'scheduling'|'workorders'|'invoicing'>('estimates')
- Keyboard: Up/Down moves; Enter/Space selects.
- aria-live="polite" on the right title.
- Prefer video if window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)') and file exists; else image.

LAYOUT / DENSITY
- Stepper item class:
  "grid grid-cols-[28px_1fr] gap-3 p-4 ring-1 ring-slate-200 bg-white elev-2 not-first:mt-2
   data-[active=true]:border-l-4 data-[active=true]:border-[#0B5FFF]
   data-[active=true]:bg-slate-50"
- Right pane header:
  "p-5 bg-slate-50 grid grid-cols-[48px_1fr] gap-3 items-center"
- Media:
  wrapper "aspect-video bg-slate-100"
  <video class="w-full h-full object-cover" muted loop playsInline autoPlay />
  <img class="w-full h-full object-cover" />
- Links row: "mt-4 flex flex-wrap gap-x-4 gap-y-2 text-[#0B5FFF] font-semibold"
- Spec chips grid: "mt-4 grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4 gap-2 text-sm text-slate-800"
- Remove excessive margins to avoid white bands.

A11Y / QA
- All focusable elements show ring-2 #0B5FFF with offset-2 white.
- No overflow at 375px. Stepper collapses to stacked list then preview.
- Lighthouse A11y ≥95.

NOTES ON MEDIA
- Prefer real screenshots or 8–12s looped screen captures (WebM).
- If assets missing, the pane shows a neutral “Preview” placeholder.
- Later you can swap in real media by dropping files in /public/img/previews or /public/video matching names above. No code changes needed.

ACCEPTANCE
- Ordered steps 1→4 visible on the left.
- Right pane shows real product media (when provided), not empty gray.
- Section feels dense, professional, and obvious. CTAs unchanged.
