Cash flow problems kill more field service businesses than lack of demand. The solution isn't getting more jobs—it's getting paid faster for the work you're already doing.

## The cash flow gap problem

<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 my-6">
  <KPIChip label="Average DSO" value="45 days" variant="danger" />
  <KPIChip label="Industry Target" value="<15 days" variant="success" />
</div>

Most field service businesses have a 30-45 day gap between completing work and receiving payment. During that time, you're covering:
- Technician wages
- Material costs
- Fuel and vehicle expenses
- Overhead

That's a recipe for cash flow crunch—even when you're profitable on paper.

## Strategy #1: Collect payment on-site

**The golden rule:** The best time to collect payment is immediately after completing the work.

<Callout type="success" title="Statistics">
Field service businesses that collect on-site have 95%+ payment rates within 24 hours. Those that invoice later average 30+ days.
</Callout>

### Make it frictionless:
- Accept all payment methods (card, ACH, mobile wallets)
- Use mobile card readers with chip/tap/swipe
- Email receipts automatically
- Never say "we'll mail you an invoice"

**Scripting for technicians:**
> "Great! Let me get you checked out. Do you prefer card or would you like to use Apple Pay?"

Not:
> ~~"We'll send you an invoice in a few days."~~

## Strategy #2: Require deposits for large jobs

For jobs over $500, collect 50% upfront.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces no-payment risk
- Covers material costs immediately
- Filters out tire-kickers
- Improves cash flow predictability

<Callout type="info">
LinkServicePro lets customers pay deposits directly from the estimate—no phone calls or manual invoicing required.
</Callout>

## Strategy #3: Offer (but don't advertise) financing

Many customers want to say yes but can't afford the full amount today.

**The approach:**
- Partner with financing provider (Wisetack, GreenSky, etc.)
- Only offer when customers express price concern
- Approval in 30 seconds on technician's mobile device
- You get paid upfront, customer pays over time

## Strategy #4: Automate payment reminders

For the jobs you can't collect on-site (commercial accounts, etc.), automation is key.

**Reminder sequence:**
- Day 0: Invoice sent immediately after job completion
- Day 7: Friendly reminder email
- Day 14: Second reminder + payment link
- Day 21: Phone call from office
- Day 30: Final notice
- Day 35: Suspend service or collections

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
Don't wait 30 days to send the first reminder. By then, your invoice is buried in their email and forgotten.
</Callout>

## Strategy #5: Make invoices scannable and clear

Your invoice should answer these questions in 5 seconds:
- What work was done?
- When was it done?
- How much is owed?
- How to pay?

### Invoice best practices:

**Bad invoice:**
```
Service call - $450
Materials - $125
Total: $575
```

**Good invoice:**
```

- Replaced 45µF dual run capacitor
- Tested system operation
- 90-day parts & labor warranty

Parts: $125
Labor: $450
Total Due: $575

## Strategy #6: Incentivize early payment

Consider offering a small discount for immediate payment:
- 2% discount if paid same-day
- Net 15 terms for regular commercial clients
- Late fees after 30 days (clearly stated upfront)

<Callout type="info">
A 2% discount costs you less than the time spent chasing late payments—and it's tax deductible.
</Callout>

## Real-world results

Here's what happens when you implement these strategies:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Average DSO | 42 days | 8 days | -81% |
| Collection rate | 87% | 98% | +11% |
| Cash on hand | $12K | $48K | +300% |
