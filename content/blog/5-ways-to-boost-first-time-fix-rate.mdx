Your first-time fix rate (FTF) is one of the most important metrics in field service. Every callback costs you money in labor, fuel, and potentially lost customers. Here's how to get it right the first time.

## Why first-time fix rate matters

The math is brutal:

<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 my-6">
  <KPIChip label="Callback Cost" value="$150-300" variant="danger" />
  <KPIChip label="Customer Churn Risk" value="+40%" variant="danger" trend="up" />
  <KPIChip label="Profit Impact" value="-25%" variant="danger" trend="down" />
</div>

A single callback can turn a profitable job into a loss. Plus, customers who experience a callback are 40% more likely to switch providers.

## Strategy #1: Stock trucks properly

**The problem:** Technicians arrive without the right parts and have to schedule a return visit.

**The fix:**
- Analyze your top 20 service calls
- Stock trucks with parts for 80% of common issues  
- Use inventory management to track truck stock in real-time
- Set par levels and automate reorder alerts

<Callout type="success" title="Quick Win">
One HVAC company increased their FTF rate from 68% to 89% simply by analyzing call patterns and restocking trucks accordingly.

## Strategy #2: Send the right technician

Not all techs have the same skills. Dispatching a junior tech to a complex diagnostic job increases callback risk.

**Best practice:**
- Tag jobs by complexity during booking
- Route advanced diagnostics to senior technicians
- Track FTF rate by technician to identify training needs
- Pair juniors with seniors on complex jobs

LinkServicePro's dispatch board lets you filter technicians by skill level and certifications, making it easy to match the right tech to each job.

## Strategy #3: Use diagnostic checklists

Rushing through diagnostics is the #1 cause of misdiagnosis and callbacks.

**Implementation:**
- Create standardized checklists for common issues
- Require photo documentation of problem areas
- Build in mandatory pause points for verification
- Review incomplete checklists before closing jobs

Example HVAC diagnostic checklist:
1. Check thermostat settings and batteries
2. Inspect air filter condition
3. Test voltage at condenser
4. Measure refrigerant pressures
5. Verify drain line flow
6. Photo documentation of findings

## Strategy #4: Better job information up-front

When your technician shows up without knowing what to expect, they're less prepared.

**Improve your intake process:**
- Ask customers to send photos of equipment before the visit
- Capture equipment make/model/age during booking
- Review service history before dispatch
- Send techs arrival notifications with job details

<KPIChip label="Preparation Time Saved" value="15 min" variant="primary" />

## Strategy #5: Track and analyze callback patterns

You can't improve what you don't measure.

**Key metrics to track:**
- Overall FTF rate
- FTF rate by job type
- FTF rate by technician
- Common reasons for callbacks
- Time between initial visit and callback

<Callout type="warning" title="Red Flag">
If one technician has a significantly lower FTF rate than others, that's a training opportunity—not necessarily a performance problem.
</Callout>

## Putting it together

Here's how these strategies compound:

| Strategy | FTF Impact |
|----------|------------|
| Proper truck stock | +12% |
| Right technician dispatch | +8% |
| Diagnostic checklists | +15% |
| Better job info | +6% |
| **Combined effect** | **+35%** |
